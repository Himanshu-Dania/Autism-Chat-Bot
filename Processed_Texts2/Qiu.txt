Screening for HighRisk ASD INTRODUCTION Autism spectrum disorder ASD is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that starts in early childhood andischaracterizedbysocialcommunicationbarriersres tricted interests repetitive stereotyped behaviors and abnormali ties in perception In recent years epidemiological survey data on the incidence of ASD showed that the prevalence rate increase d from to in China A large number of studies on ASD have shown that early intervention helps improve patient prognosis However age at ASD diagnosis is still months or even later Therefore early detection early diagnosis and eective intervention are essential to achieve a better progn osis Understanding the early childhood behaviors of ASD will help facilitate early intervention in infants and toddlers who a re suspectedofhavingASDandimprovetheirprognosiswhichhas veryimportantsocialandeconomicimplications The early social interaction between adults and children is the basis of more complex social cognition For children with ASD the lack of social abilities is especially prominent in th eir early life According to the version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fth edition DSM ASD symptoms are usually present in young children at the age of years Occasionally initial symptoms often invol ve delayed language development accompanied by a lack of social interest or unusual social interactions quirky play modes a nd unusual communication patterns A study by Barbaro and Dissanayakeonfamilyvideosandparentalreportsrevealedea rly warning signs in social interactions of children with ASD ag ed to months old which included lack of joint attention lack of eye contact lack of social smiling lack of social in terest and sharing no response to calling name lack of gestures an d communication impairments This study would focus on the dierences of early social behavior between HR group and TD group Previous studies on early behavioral abnormalitie s in ASD were mostly in the form of retrospective interviews with parents or scalebased evaluations which are highly subjec tive and unfavorable for widespread promotion In recent years an increasing number of studies have adopted objective methods involvingvideoforusingbehavioralcoding Tronick et al proposed the stillface paradigm SFP to test infants emotion regulation ability and social expectation s in social interaction Early maternalinfant interaction is the core basis of infants social emotion emotion regulation and social and communication development The maternal infant relationship is the rst relationship developed in ea rly childhood Flexible and frequent interaction is the basis f or earlychildhoodemotionalorganizationattentionswitch ingand the emergence of social skills In the early maternal infant interaction nonverbal communication is dominant In addition in this process young children learn the rules of social participation and expressing forms of social expectatio ns which provide a social framework for future social interacti ons and relationships There were studies applied SFP in emotional regulatory of ASD and they found most of children with ASD employed more simple regulatory behavior and less complex strategies Additional Cassel et al alsofound that there were diculties for children with ASD to develop socioemotional ability In this study the SFP was used to measure social behavior of HR group and TDgroup Therewerestudiesappliedmachinelearningmethodstobuild model for early screening of ASD based on the characteristic values of biological indicators such as electroencephalog ram and brain images and they found the accuracy was more than And in order to improve the stability and reliability of model for early screening of ASD it is essenti al to combiningsocialbehavioralindicatorswithbiologicalin dicators in the subsequent research In this study we would try to build a model for early screening of ASD based on social behavioralindicators METHODS Participants Fortyve infants and toddlers with highrisk autism spectrum disorder HR who sought treatment at the outpatient clinic of Child Mental Health Research Center Nanjing Brain Hospital Aliated to Nanjing Medical University from December toDecemberwereenrolledintheHRgroupandinfants and toddlers with typical development TD in the Nanjing area were recruited during the same period and enrolled into the controlgrouptheTDgroup The inclusion criteria for the HR group were as follows children with positive results based on the Modied Checklist for Autism in Toddlers MCHAT pediatric psychiatrist recognized that the children met the core crite ria of ASD in DSM but the months age was under months children aged to months old children whose primary caregiver was the mother and children whose guardians agreed to participate in this study The exclusion criteria for the HR group were as follows children with genetic or metabolic diseases such as Rett syndrome and fragile X syndrome children with neurodevelopmental disorders other than ASD such as language development disorders alone and intellectual disability children with a clear history of craniocerebral trauma and children with a history of nervous system diseases and serious physicalillnesses The inclusion criteria for the TD group were as follows children with TD whose sex matched that of the children in the HR group children aged to months old children whose primary caregiver was the mother and children whose guardians agreed to participate in this stud y The exclusion criteria for the TD group were as

transitioning from the baseline episo de to the SF episode this eect has been recognized and termed the SF eect In relevant studies researchers also fo und that the reason for the generation of the SF

was a dierence between age and the developmental level and social behaviors of some infants and toddlers in the HR group and the TD group but the dierence was not representative ie th e age and developmental level of the infants and toddlers did no t inuence their social behaviors under general conditions Forinfants and toddlers with HR the analysis of the correlatio n between clinical symptoms and social behaviors showed that there was no correlation between social behaviors and sympto m severity during the FF episode of the SFP During the SF episode the duration of eye contact by infants and toddlers with HR was positively correlated with the symbolic behavior factor score and the total CSBSDP score the duration of soc ial smiling was positively correlated with the social

and the total CSBSDP score and the frequency of eye contact was positively correlated with the social communication fac tor scorethelanguagefactorscoreandthetotalCSBSDPscore The results indicated that the more exible and appropriate the eye contact and active social engagement of the infants and todd lers with HR the less severe were the ASD symptoms which is also consistentwiththeresultsofmoststudies Althoughthe social behaviors of infants and toddlers with ASD develop ove r time their development level is limited the gap between inf ants and toddlers with ASD and infants and toddlers with TD also increases over time and infants and toddlers with ASD develo p moreclinicalsymptomsofASD The SFP presents changes in childrens expressions emotions and behaviors in a more microscopic coding mode On the basis of setting a normal interaction the SFP provides a soci al challenge scenario by setting the SF episode during which the social signals of the mother are completely missing during th e period For typically developing children their inability to adapt to the loss of social signals stimulated their ability to ini tiate socialinteractionsexpressemotionsregulateemotionsan dbear stress The analysis of the above results showed that the soci al behaviors in infants and toddlers with HR especially their soc ial behaviors during the SF episode of the SFP were associated wit h the core ASD symptoms According to the extreme male brain theory of autism the toddlers with ASD are more prone

world theory suggesting that an excessively active brain would excessively amplify ordinary sensory experiences causing the toddlers with ASD to be in a state of fragmented sensory information and to be overloade d and because of such a strong reaction the intense emotions perceived by them from the surrounding environment causes social withdrawal resulting in a series of autism symptoms s uch
