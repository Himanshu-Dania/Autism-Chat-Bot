September Revised March Editorial Decision March Accepted April ABSTRACT Background Existing screening tools for early detection of autism are expensive cumbersome time intensive and sometimes fall short in predictive value In this work we sought to apply Machine Learning ML to goldstandard clinical data obtained across thousands of children atrisk for autism spectrum disorder to create alowcost quick and easy to apply autism screening tool Methods Two algorithms are trained to identify autism one based on short structured parentreported ques tionnaires and the other on tagging key behaviors from short semistructured home videos of children A combination algorithm is then used to combine the results into a single assessment of higher accuracy To overcome the scarcity sparsity and imbalance of training data we apply novel feature selection featureengineering and feature encoding techniques We allow for inconclusive determination where appropriate inorder to boost screening accuracy when conclusive The performance is then validated in a controlled clinicalstudy Results A multicenter clinical study of n children is performed to ascertain the performance of these algorithms and their combination We demonstrate a signicant accuracy improvement over standard screening tools in measurements of AUC sensitivity and specicity Conclusion These ndings suggest that a mobile machine learning process is a reliable method for detection of autism outside of clinical settings A variety of confounding factors in the clinical analysis are discussed alongwith the solutions engineered into the algorithms Final results are statistically limited and will benet from future clinical studies to extend the sample size Key words supervised machine learning autism spectrum disorder diagnostic techniques and procedures mobile applications INTRODUCTION Diagnosis within the first few years of life dramatically improves the outlook of children with autism as it allows for treatment while the childs brain is still rapidly developingUnfortunately autism is typically not diagnosed earlier than age in the United States withapproximately of cases remaining undiagnosed at age This delay in diagnosis is driven primarily by a lack of effective screening tools and a shortage of specialists to evaluate atrisk children Theuse of higher accuracy screening tools to prioritize children to be seen by specialists is therefore essentialMost autism screeners in use today are based on questions for the parent or the medical practitioner that produce results by comparing summed answer scores to predetermined thresholds Notableexamples are the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised MCHAT a checklistbased screening tool for autism that is intended to be administered during developmental screenings forchildren between the ages of and months and the Child Behavior Checklist CBCL Both are parentcompleted screening tools For both instruments responses to each question are summedwith each question given equal weighting and if the total is above apredetermined threshold the child is considered to be at high risk of VCThe Authors

conditions TheAutism Spectrum Problems scale of CBCL is used when comparingits performance to the performances of our algorithms in this paper In this paper we present two new machine learning screeners that are reliable costeffective short enough to be completed in minutesand achieve higher accuracy than existing screeners on the same agespan as existing screeners One is based on a short questionnaire about the child which is answered by the parent The other is based on iden tification of specific behaviors by trained analysts after watching twoor three short videos of the child within their natural environmentthat are captured by parents using a mobile device The parent questionnaire screener keys on behavioral patterns similar to those probed by a standard autism diagnostic instrumentthe Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised ADIR This clinical tool consists of an interview of the parent with multipart questions with multiple choice and numeric responses which are delivered by a trained professional in a clinical setting While thisinstrument is considered a goldstandard and gives consistentresults across examiners the cost and time to administer it can beprohibitive in a primary care setting In this paper we present ourapproach to using clinical ADIR instrument data to create ascreener based on a short questionnaire presented directly to parentswithout supervision The video screener keys on behavioral patterns similar to those probed in another diagnostic tool the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS ADOS is widely considered a gold standard and is one of the most common behavioral instruments used to aidin the diagnosis of autism It consists of an interactive and struc tured examination of the child by trained clinicians in a tightly controlled setting ADOS is a multimodular diagnostic instrumentwith different modules for subjects at different levels of cognitive development In this paper we present our approach to mining ADOSclinical records with a focus on younger developmental age to create a videobased screener that relies on an analyst evaluating shortvideos of children filmed by their parents at home The use of behavioral patterns commonly probed in ADIR and ADOS scoresheets as inputs to train autism screening classifiers wasintroduced studied and clinically validated in previous work There are several new aspects in this paper First the algorithms de tailed in the present study have been designed to be more accurate and more robust against confounding biases between training and application data Next this paper focuses considerable attention onthe impact of confounding factors on machine learning algorithmsin this context Examples of these confounding biases will be discussed below and highlighted in Table Labeled data usually origi nates from tightly controlled clinical environments and is henceclean but sparse unbalanced and of a different context to the dataavailable when applying the screening techniques in a less formal environment This paper also presents a combination between thealgorithms for a more powerful single screener Lastly this papergeneralizes the algorithms to be nonbinary sometimes resulting inan inconclusive determination when presented with data frommore challenging cases This allows higher screening accuracy forthose children who do receive a conclusive screening while still presenting a clinically actionable inconclusive outcome in the morechallenging cases These classifiers of this paper were applied to screen children in a clinical study using the Cognoa App To date Cognoa has been used by over parents in the US and internationally The majority of Cognoa users are parents of young children between and months The clinical study consisted of atrisk children who had undergone full clinical examination and received a clinical diagnosis at a center specialized in neurodevelopmental disorders METHODS It is not feasible to amass large training sets of children who havebeen evaluated by the mobile screeners and who also have received aprofessional medical diagnosis Our approach is to start with historical medical instrument records of previously diagnosed subjectsand use those as training data for screeners that will rely on information acquired outside the clinical setting Expected performance degradation from applying the algorithms into a less controlled settingwould result in inaccurate screeners if conventional machine learning methods were used Much of this paper outlines the details ofcreative machine learning methods designed to overcome this challenge and create reliable screeners in this setting Training data were compiled from multiple repositories of ADOS and ADIR scoresheets of children between and months of age including Boston Autism Consortium Autism Ge netic Resource Exchange Autism Treatment Network Simons Sim plex Collection and Vanderbilt Medical Center Since suchrepositories are highly imbalanced with very few nonautisticpatients the controls across the datasets were supplemented withbalancing data obtained by conducting ADIR interviews by atrained clinician on a random sample of children deemed at low riskfor autism from Cognoas user base For both algorithms a smallerset of optimal features was selected using methods that will be discussed below Details about the final selected features are given intheSupplementary Material The clinical validation sample consists of children who pre sented to one of three autism centers in the United States between and months of age All participants were referred through theclinics typical referral program process and only those withEnglishspeaking parents were considered for the study The threeclinical centers were approved on a multisite IRB project number Every child received an ADOS as well as standard screeners like MCHAT and CBCL as appropriate and a diagnosis was ultimately ascertained by a licensed health care provider For ofthose children the parents also used their mobile devices to complete the short parental questionnaire and submit the short videosrequired for the screeners discussed in this paper The sample breakdown by age group and diagnosis for both the training and clinicalvalidation datasets is shown in Table Approach We trained two independent ML classifiers and combined their out puts into a single screening assessment The parent questionnaireclassifier was trained using data from historical itemlevel ADIRscoresheets with labels corresponding to established clinical diagnoses The video classifier was trained using ADOS instrument scoresheets and diagnostic labels In each case progressive sampling wasused to verify sufficient training volume as detailed in the Supple mentary Materials Multiple machine learning algorithms were eval uated including ensemble techniques on the training data A numberof algorithms performed well Random Forests were chosen becauseof robustness against overfitting ADIR and ADOS instruments are designed to be administered by trained professionals in highly standardized clinical settings and typically take hours In contrast our screening methods are deliberatelyJournal of the American Medical Informatics Association Vol No designed to be administered at home by parents without expert super vision and to take only minutes to complete This change of environment causes significant data degradation and biases resulting in anexpected loss of screening accuracy For each classifier we presentmindful adjustments to ML methodology to mitigate these issuesThese biases and efforts to mitigate them are discussed below Differences Between Training and Application Environments The screeners are trained on historical patient records that corre spond to controlled lengthy clinical examinations but applied viaweb or mobile app aimed at unsupervised parents at home Table details the various mechanisms by which confounding biases mayconsequently creep into the application data Note that inaccuraciesintroduced by such biases cannot be probed by cross validation orsimilar analysis of the training data alone Hyperparameter Optimization For each parental questionnaire and video model that will be discussed below model hyperparameters were tuned with a bootstrapped grid search In all cases class labels were used to stratifythe folds and age label pairs were used to weightbalance the samples More details can be found in the Supplementary Materials Parent Questionnaire Multiple model variants representing incremental improvements over a generic ML classification approach are discussed below Generic ML Baseline Variant A random forest was trained over the ADIR instrument data Each of the instruments data columns was treated as a categoricalvariable and onehot encoded The subjects age and gender were included as features as well Of the resulting set of features the top were selected using featureimportance ranking in the decisionforest Robust Feature Selection Variant Due to the small size and sparsity of the training dataset generic feature selection was not robust and the selected features along withthe performance of the resulting model fluctuated from run to rundue to the stochastic nature of the learners underlying bagging approach Many ADIR questions are highly correlated leading tomultiple competing sets of feature selection choices that were seemingly equally powerful during training but which had different performance characteristics when the underlying sampling bias wasexposed via full bootstrapped crossvalidation This resulted in awide performance range of the variant of the Generic ML baselinemethod as shown in Table Table Dataset Breakdown by Age Group and Condition Type for Each of the Sources of Training Data

C Table Differences Between Training and Application Environments These Differences are Expected to Cause Bias that Cannot be Cap tured by Crossvalidation Studies Aspect Training Setting Application Setting Source ADIR and ADOS instrument administered by trained professionals during clinicalevaluationsShort parent questionnaires displayed on smartphone and behavior tagging by analysts after observing two or three minute home videos uploaded byparents Proctor Highly trained medical professionals Parents answering the questionnaires are untrained and the analysts evaluating the home videos are only minimally trained As a result their answers may not be as consistent objective or reliable Setting Clinic setting with highly standardized and semistructured interactionsAt home Not possible to recreate the structured clinical environment resulting in an undesired variability of the output signals Subjects might also behave differ ently at the clinic than at home further amplifying the bias Duration The ADIR can take up to hours to com plete The ADOS can take up to minutes of direct observation by trainedprofessionalsUnder minutes to complete the parent questionnaire and a few minutes of home video As a result some symptoms and behavioral patterns might be pre sent but not observed Also causes big uncertainty about the severity and frequency of observed symptoms Questionnaires Sophisticated language involving psycholog ical concepts terms and subtleties unfa miliar to nonexpertsSimplied questions and answer choices result in less nuanced noisier inputs Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association Vol No Robust feature selection overcame that limitation using a two step approach First a count bootstrapped feature selectionwas run with a weight balanced random sample selected ineach iteration The top features were selected each time and arankinvariant tally was kept for the number of times each featuremade it to a top list Next the top features in the tally werekept as candidates and all other features were discarded A finalfeatureselection run was used to pick the best subset of these candidate features This approach was found to be more robust to statistical fluctuations usually selecting the same set of features whenrun multiple times A minimal subset of maximally performant features was chosen and locked for clinical validation totaling features for the young children and features for the old Detailsabout these selected features are available in the Supplementary Material Age Silo Variant This variant built upon the improvements of the robust feature selec tion method by exploiting of the dichotomy between prephrasal and fullyphrasal language capability in atrisk children Languagedevelopment is significant in this domain as it is known to affect thenature in which autism presents and consequently the kinds of behavioral clues to look for in order to screen for it This variant achieved better performance by training separate classifiers for children in the younger and older age groups ofTable The age dichotomy of C was chosen to serve as the best proxy for language ability Feature selection model parametertuning and crossvalidation were run independently for each agegroup classifier Before siloing by age group the classifier was limited to selecting features that work well across children of both developmental stages Siloing enabled the classifiers to specialize onfeatures that are most developmentally appropriate within each agegroupSeveritylevel Feature Encoding Variant Building upon the method including age siloing above this variant achieved better performance by replacing onehot feature encodingwith a more contextappropriate technique Onehot encoding doesnot distinguish between values that correspond to increasing levels of severity of a behavioral symptom and values that do not convey a clearconcept of severity This is especially troublesome since a typical ADIR instrument question includes answer choices from both types of values For example ADIR question which focuses on the childs tendency to confuse and mix up pronouns allows for answer codes and Among those choices through denote increasingdegrees of severity in pronominal confusion while denotes any othertype of pronominal confusion not cove red in regardless of severity Codes and denote the nonapplicability of the question for example to a child still incapable of phrasal speech or the lack of an answerfor example if the question was skipped respectively When codingthe answers to such questions generic onehot encoding would allowfor nonsymptomatic answer codes to be selected as screening featuresbased on phantom correlations present in the dataset Severitylevel encoding converts all answer codes that do not con vey a relevant semantic concept to a common value thereby reducing the chance of useless feature selection and reducing the number of features to choose from In addition severitylevel encoding condenses thesignal according to increasing ran ges of severity For example the encoding of ADIR question would map its responses to new features with s in the following cases all other new features would bezero None This more closely resembles the way medical prac titioners interpret such answer choi ces and helps alleviate the problem of sparsity over each of the onehot encoded features in the dataset Aggregate Features Variant Building upon the method including severity level encoding abovethis variant achieved better performance by incorporating aggregateTable Performance

Informatics Association Vol No features such as the minimum maximum and average severity level as well as number of answer choices by severity level across thequestions corresponding to the selected features These new features were especially helpful due to the sparse shallow and wide nature of the training set whereupon any semantically meaningfulcondensation of the signal can be useful to the trained classifier Inconclusive Results Variant Children with more complex symptom presentation are known topose challenges to developmental screening These children oftenscreen as false positives or false negatives resulting in an overalldegradation of screening accuracy that is observed by all standardmethods and has become acceptable in the industry Given that ourlowcost instruments do not rely on sophisticated observations todifferentiate complex symptom cases our approach was to avoidassessing them altogether and to try instead to spot and label themas inconclusive Building upon the method including feature engineering two methods to implement this strategy were devised The first was totrain a binary classifier with a continuous output score then replacethe cutoff threshold with a cutoff range with values within the cutoff range considered inconclusive A grid search was used to determine the optimal cutoff range representing a tradeoff betweeninconclusive determination rate and accuracy over conclusive subjects The second approach was to train and crossvalidate a simplebinary classifier label the correctly and incorrectly predicted samples as conclusive or inconclusive respectively and then build a sec ond classifier to predict whether a subject would be incorrectly classified by the first classifier At runtime the second classifier wasused to spot and label inconclusives The conclusives were sent forclassification by a third binary classifier trained over the conclusivesamples only Both methods for labeling inconclusive results yieldedsimilar performance Therefore the simpler method of using athreshold range in the machine learning output was used to reportinconclusive results for this paper The inconclusive rate is a configurable model parameter that controls the tradeoff between coverage and accuracy Throughoutthis paper the inconclusive rate for this variant was set to Video The second of our twomethod approach to autism screening is anML classifier that uses input answers about the presence and severityof target behaviors among subjects This information was providedby an analyst upon viewing two or three minute home videos ofchildren in semistructured settings that are taken by parents ontheir mobile phones The classifier was trained on itemlevel data from two of the ADOS modules module preverbal module phrased speech and corresponding clinical diagnosis Two decision forest ML classifiers were trained corresponding to each ADOS module For each classifier questions were selectedusing the same robust feature selection method and the same allowance for inconclusive outcomes was made as for the parental questionnaire classifier Each model was independently parametertunedwith a bootstrapped grid search Class labels were used to stratifythe crossvalidation folds and age label pairs were used to weightbalance the samples Problems related to the change of environment from training to application are especially significant in the case of video screeningbecause ADOS involves a minute direct observation of the childby experts whereas our screening was based on unsupervised shorthome videos Specifically we expect the likelihood of inconclusive or unobserved behaviors and symptoms to be much higher in the application than in the training data and the assessed level of severityor frequency of observed symptoms to be less reliable in the application than in the training data The following improvements weredesigned to help overcome these limitations Presence of Behavior Encoding To minimize potential bias from a video analyst misreading the severity of a symptom in a short cell phone video this encodingscheme improves feature reliability at the expense of feature information content by collapsing all severity gradations of a questioninto one binary value representing the presence vs absence of the behavior or symptom in question Importantly a value of denotesthe presence of behavior regardless of whether the behavior is indicative of autism or of normalcy This rule ensures that a value of corresponds to a reliable observation whereas a does not necessarily indicate the absence of a symptom but possibly the failure to observe the symptom within the short window of observation Missing Value Injection to Balance the Nonpresence of Features for the Video Screener Training DataWhile collapsing severity gradations into a single category overcomes noisy severity assessment it does not help with the problemof a symptom not present or unnoticeable in a short home videoFor this reason it is important that the learning algorithm treat avalue of as semantically meaningful and a value of as inconse quential To this end we augmented the training set with duplicate samples that had some feature values flipped from to The injection of s was randomly performed with probabilities such that thesampleweighted ratio of positive to negative samples for which thevalue of any particular feature is is about Such ratios ensurethat the trees in a random forest will be much less likely to drawconclusions from the absence of a feature Combination It is desirable to combine the questionnaire and video screeners toachieve higher accuracy However the needed overlapping trainingset was not available Instead the clinical validation dataset itselfwas used to train the combination model The numerical responses of each of the parent questionnaire and video classifiers were combined using Lregularized logistic regression which has the advantage of reducing the concern of overfittingparticularly given the logistic model has only three free parametersBootstrapping and cross validation studies showed that any overfitting that may be present from this procedure is not detectable withinstatistical limitations Since each of the individual methods wassiloed by age separate combination algorithms were trained per agegroup silo For each combination algorithm optimal inconclusiveoutput criteria were chosen using the logistic regression responseusing the same techniques as for the parental questionnaire andvideo classifiers The performance characteristics of the overallscreening process compared to standard alternative screeners are shown below RESULTS Parent Questionnaire Performance on Training Data Bootstrapped crossvalidation performance metrics for the optimally parametertuned version of each of the variants of the parental Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association Vol No questionnaire are reported in the top of Table The results for baseline variant are reported as a range rather than a single value because the unreliability of generic feature selection leads to different sets of features selected from run to run with varying performance results Parents of children included in the clinical study answered short ageappropriate questions chosen using the robust feature selectionmethod discussed above The clinical performance

validation datasets is driven by the differencesthat are emphasized in Table See below and the results of Table for a discussion of the statistical significance of these results ROC curves in Figure show how our parent questionnaire clas sification approach outperforms some of the established screeningtools like MCHAT and CBCL on the clinical sample Since clinicalcenters are usually interested in screening tools with a high sensitivity we have drawn shaded regions between and sensitivity to aid the eye Combination Screening Performance on Clinical Data ROC curves in Figure show how combining the questionnaire and video classifiers into a single assessment further boosted performance on the clinical study sample When up to of the mostchallenging cases are allowed to be determined inconclusive the performance on the remaining cases is shown in Figure Note that the ROC curves in these figures for MCHAT contain only younger children mostly under four years of age due to the fact that this instru ment is not intended for older children A samesample comparison between MCHAT and the ML screeners can be seen in the agebinned figures Figures and Results for Young Children Young children are of particular interest given the desire to identify autism as early as possible Results restricted to only children lessthan four years old are shown in Figures andStatistical Significance For the training data sample sizes are large enough that statistical limitations are minimal However results reported for the clinicaldata have significant statistical limitations In this section we compare the performance of the screening algorithms on the clinicaldata that we have discussed in this paper the questionnairebased algorithm of MCHAT CBCL the questionnairebased algorithm of this paper and the combined questionnaire plus video algorithm of this paper Direct comparisonsin performance between many of these algorithms are reportedalong with statistical significances in Table DISCUSSION We have introduced a novel machine learning algorithm based on a parental questionnaire and another based on short home videosrecorded by parents and scored by a minimally trained analyst Wehave discussed pitfalls such as data sparsity and the mixed ordinaland categorical nature of the questions in our training data Wehave also identified several important confounding factors that arisefrom differences between the training and application settings of the algorithms We have shown novel feature encoding feature selec tion and feature aggregation techniques to address these challengesand have quantified their benefits We have shown the benefits ofallowing some subjects with lower certainty output from the algorithms to be classified as inconclusive We have also shown the benefits of combining the results of the two algorithms into a singledetermination By specializing the machine learning models on a dichotomy of age groups we found that the screener for younger children capitalized on nonverbal behavioral features such as eye contact gesturesand facial expressions while the screener for older children focusedmore on verbal communication and interactions with other childrenFor more details please refer to the Supplementary Material The methods and resulting improvements shown in this paper are expected to translate well into other clinical science
