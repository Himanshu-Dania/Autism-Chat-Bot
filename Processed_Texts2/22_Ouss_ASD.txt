recorded infants with West syndrome WS and typically developing TD controls during astandardized mother infant interaction We computed infant hand movements HM speech turn taking of both partners

intellectualdisability ID of infants with WS at years At followup infants developed ASDID WS The best machine learning reached accuracy classifying WS vs TD and accuracy classifying WS vs WS The best features to distinguish WS and WS included a combination of infant vocalizations and HM features combined with synchrony vocalization features These data indicate that behavioral and interaction imaging was able to predict ASDID in highrisk children with WS Introduction Behavior and interaction imaging is a promising domain of affective computing to expl ore psychiatric conditions Regarding child psychiatry many researchers haveattempted to identify reliable indicators of neurodevelopmental disorders NDD in highrisk populations eg sib lings of children with autism during the rst year of life to recommend early interventions However social signals and any alterations of them are very dif cult to identify at such a young age In addition exploring the quality and dynamics of early interactions is a complex endeavor Itusually requires i the perception and integration of multimodal social signals and ii an understanding of how twointeractive partners synchronize and proceed in turn taking Affective computing offers the possibility to simulta neously analyze the interaction of several partners whileconsidering the multimodal nature and dynamics of socialsignals and behaviors To date few seminal studies have attempted to apply social signal processing to mother infant interactions with or without a speci c condition and these studies have focused on speech turnseg Jaffe et al motherese head movements hand movements movement kinematics and facial expressions Here we focused on West syndrome WS a rare epi leptic encephalopathy with early onset before age year and a high risk of NDD outcomes including onethird of WS children showing later autism spectrum disorderASD andor intellectual disability ID We recruited infants with WS and typically developing TD controlsto

interaction protocol and followed infants with WS to assess outcomes at years of age We aim to explorewhether multimodal social signals and interpersonal synchrony of infant mother interactions at months could predict outcomes Materials and methods Design participants and clinical measures We performed a prospective followup study of infants with WS The Institutional Review Board Comit de Protection des Personnes from the GroupeHospitalier Necker Enfants Malades approved the study and both parents gave written informed consent after they receivedverbal and written information on the study They wereasked to participate to a followup study to assess outcome of WS taking into account development earlyinteraction genetics and response to pharmacologicaltreatment The study was conducted from November to March in the Neuropediatrics Department Center for Rare Epilepsia of Necker EnfantsMalades Hospital Paris Of the patients screened during thestudy period we enrolled all but two cases N with WS Seven patients dropped out before the age of leading to a sample of patients with detailed followupdata Typical developing infants N were recruited from Maternal and Infant Prevention institutions inpediatric consultations or by proxyTo assess neurodevelopmental outcomes we focused on ID and ASD ID was assessed through the BrunetLzine Developmental Examination performed for all children at the age of years The BrunetLzine Developmental Examination estimates a developmental quotient DQbased upon normative data available for yearoldFrench toddlers The diagnosis of autism was based upon several measurements and an expert assessmentthat was blind to other variables i At years of age allparents completed the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised ADIR to assess autism signs by dimensions and developmental delay ii At and years of age all patients were assessed with the Children s Autism Rating Scale CARS iii An expert clinician LR who was blind to child history assessed autism and ID from minvideotapes of childmother play at years of age Finallydiagnoses of ASD andor ID at age were based upon aconsensus approach using direct assessment of the childby a clinician with expertise in autism LO as well as by clinical information from the CARS ADIR and DQ Video recordings Infant mother interactions were assessed between and months of age during a play

after instructing the mother to interact as usual without any toy sequence free play using the help of a toy Sophie the giraffe sequence mother singing to her baby Due tothe position of the baby chair on the oor and the mother s seated position the mother was positioned slightly higher in all of the recordings The mother s indicated position was on the left of the child as shown onthe picture but exceptions were sometimes observedduring the recordings For infant hand movement HM features min was extracted from each min video and all recordings according to two criteria the child s hands should be visible for at least part of the sequence eg themother is not leaning on the child and the minuterepresented the greatest amount of interaction betweenthe mother and the child For audio and speech turntaking computing we only used the min audiorecording of sequence Vision computing Fig SB vision computing panel To process infant hand movements HM we used the methods developed in Ouss et al Here we summarize the successive steps to calculate HM features In step hand trajectory extraction and data processing the twodimensional coordinates of the hand were extracted fromeach of the video recordings by tracking a wristband on the right hand yellow in Fig SA videoaudio recording panel The tracking framework comprised three stepsprediction observation and estimation as proposed inref As the hand motion was highly nonlinear we developed an approach using a bootstrapbased particlelter with a rstorder model to address abrupt changes in direction and speed To address hand occlusion we implemented an approach combining tracking with detection by adding a boolean variable to the state vector associated with each particle Each extracted trajectory consisted of pairs of x andycoordinates frames per second generating pairs of coordinates in the s see Fig S left panelvision computing The frames where the hand was notvisible were clearly indicated in each trajectory as missingcoordinates for these time points To account for differ ences in the camera zoom parameters the trajectories obtained were normalized using a xed reference system present in the settings of each video recording The normalization was performed on all trajectories and ofthe normalization factors ranged between and with a few outlier trajectories that required greater correction Fortyone percent of the trajectories required correction Although the recordings between the two cameras were synchronized and in principle allowed D reconstruction of the trajectory the accumulation ofmissing data prevented such reconstruction However Dmotion capture with appropriately de ned movement descriptors can be powerful for detecting clinically relevant changes thereby justifying the independent ana lysis of the Dtrajectory videos see Fig SB vision computing d panel on the left In step the descriptors of the HM were calculated from the planar trajectories Fig SB table shown in thevision computing panel Descriptors covered thosealready reported in the literature as important in characterizing infants HM To describe the space explored by the hand we calculated the maximum dis tance observed on the two axes xRange yRange and the standard deviation of the X and Y coordinates observedduring the s xSd ySd We also calculated the maximum distance between any two points of the trajectoryusing the FarthestPair java library princetoneducode Fig SB vision computing panel red line in the third panel from the left To evaluateHM dynamics we calculated the velocity and accelera tion Also related to HM dynamics we calculated HM pauses de ned as part of the trajectory in which the velocity was lower than a speci c threshold for a mini mum duration of s Finally the curvature of thetrajectories was calculated using a standard de nition of the curvature of plane curves in Cartesian coordinates astxtyt The curvature calculated at each point of the trajectory is presented in the right panel of Fig SB video computing where the rst s of the trajectory are plotted and the associated calculated curvatures ateach point and respective time indicated on the axis arepresented as columns Audio computing Fig SC audio computing We extracted two types of audio social signals from the audio channel of the mother infant interaction speech turn taking STT and motherese For STT extraction we followed the methods developed by Weisman et aland Bourvis et alFig S audio computing First we used ELAN to segment the infants and mothers speech turns and annotate the dialog acts Mothers audio interactions were categorized as mother vocalization meaningfulvocalizations laugh singing animal sounds or othernoise clap hands snap ngers or snap the tongue mouth noise etc Similarly infants audio production was dened as infant vocalization babbling vocalizations laugh and cry or atypical vocalization other noise suchas rale The infant s and mother s utterances were labeled by two annotators blind to group status Cohen s kappa between the two annotators was calculated for eachdyad each task and each item of the grid For all items thekappa values were between and From the annotation we extracted all the speech turns of the infant and the mother A speech turn is a continuous stream of speech with ms of silence WeOuss et al Translational Psychiatry Page of obtained a list of triples speaker label infant or mother start time and duration of speech turn From these tripleswe also deduced the start time and duration of the time segments when the mother or the infant were not speaking pauses Therefore we extracted M other Vocalizations Mother Other Noise Infant Vocalizations Infant Atypical Vocalizations Mother Pauses Infant Pauses We also extracted three dyadic features Silence dened as sequences of time during which neither participant was speaking for more than ms Overlap Ratio dened as the duration of vocalization overlaps between mothers and infants divided by the duration of the total interaction This ratio measures theproportion of interactional time in which both participants were simultaneously vocalizing Infant Syn chrony Ratio dened as the number of infants responses to their mother s vocalization within a time limit of s divided by the number of mother vocalizations during thetime paradigm The s window was based on the avail able literature on synchrony From the mother vocalizations we also computed affective speech analysis as previous work has shown thatmotherese may shape parentinfant interactions The segments of mother vocalizations were analyzed using acomputerized classi er for categorization as motherese or nonmothereseother speech initially developed to analyze home movies The system exploits the fusion of two classi ers namely segmental and suprasegmental Consequently the utterances are characterized by bothsegmental Mel frequency cepstrum coef cients and suprasegmentalprosodics eg statistics with regard tofundamental frequency energy and duration featuresThe detector used the GMM Gaussian mixture modelclassi er for both segmental and suprasegmental features M number of Gaussians for the GMM Classi erM and respectively and weighting coef cient used in the equation fusion For the purpose of the current study we explored the performance of ourmotherese classi er in French mothers We analyzed sequences from French mothers motherese vs other speech that were blindly validated by twopsycholinguists We calculated the Intraclass correlationICC between the two raters the expert and the algo rithm and found a good and very signi cant ICC ICC CI p This level of predic tion made it suitable for further analysis of the entiredata set Based on this automatic detection of motherese we created two subclasses for mother vocalizations motherese vs nonmotherese Two variables were derivedMotherese Ratio duration of motherese vocalization duration of interaction and Nonmotherese Ratio dura tion of nonmotherese vocalizationduration of interaction We also derived two synchrony ratios SynchronyMotherese Ratio and Synchrony Nonmotherese Ratio which re ect the ratio of time during which the infant vocalizes in response to hisher mother motherese and other speech nonmotherese Prediction of the outcome using machine learning The pipeline of our approach is shown in Fig First a data quality analysis was performed to ensure the validityof the data As expected all data were available for audioanalysis However a substantial proportion of the datawere discarded due to video recording or vision com puting issues We nally kept video recordings for the WS and videos for the TD groups Second given thenumber of features infant HM for each camera andeach sequence STT compared with the data

without ID ASD WS For each classi cation we also extracted a confusion matrix and explored which individual featurescontributed the most to a given classi cation using Pearson correlations Results Table S summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of children with WS At followup infants out of children with WS developed ASDIDWS Eight children had ASD and ID whereas had only ID As expected all variables related to ASD and IDwere signi cantly different in WS compared with WS Figure a summarizes the best classi cation models using the decision stump algorithm leave one out Asshown multimodal classi cation outperformed unimodal classi cation to distinguish WS and TD Therefore we only used the multimodal approach to classify WS vs WS The best model reached accuracy

all errors came from TD being misclassi ed as WS N when clas sifying WS vs WS most errors came from WS being misclassi ed as WS N Table lists the best features for each multimodal classi cation based on the Pearson correlation values The best features to distinguish WS and TD included four infant HM features mother audio feature In contrast the best features to distinguish WS and WS included a

Translational Psychiatry Page of synchrony vocalization features N and infant HM features N the last of which showed lower correla tion scores Discussion To the best of our knowledge this is the rst study to apply multimodal social signal processing tomother infant interactions in the context of WS Com bining speech turns and infant HM during aninfant mother interaction at months signi cantly pre dicted the development of ASD or severe to moderate ID at years of age in the highrisk children with WS Confusion matrices showed that the classi cation errors were not random enhancing the interest of the computational method proposed here In addition the bestcontributing features for the performed classi cations differed when classifying WS vs TD and WS vs WS Infant HMs were the most signi cant features to distin guish WS versus TD probably re ecting the motor impact due to acute WS encephalopathy For classifying WSvs WS the contribution of infant audio features and synchrony features became much more relevantcombined with several HM features We believe that the importance of synchrony and reciprocity during early interactions is in line withrecent studies that have investigated the risk of ASD orNDD during the rst year of life from home movies eg refs from prospective followup of highrisk i n f a n t ss u c ha ss i b l i n g s e g r e f s or infants with WS eg ref and from prospective studies assessing tools to screen risk for autism eg ref In the eld of ASD synchrony reciprocity parental sensitivity and emotional engagement are now proposed as targets ofearly interventions which could prevent early inter active vicious circl es Parents of atrisk infants try to compensate for the lack of interactivity of their child by modifying their stimulation and therefore sometimesreinforcing the dysfunctional interactions E a r l y identi cation of these interactive targets is especially useful among babies with neurological comorbiditiesbecause delays in developmental milestones andimpairments in early social interactions are not suf cient to predict ASD Similarly we believe that the importance of HM in distinguishing WS vs TD on one hand and WS vs WSon the other hand is also in line with the studies that investigated the importance of nonsocial behaviorsfor investigating the risk of ASD or NDD during the rst year of life For example studying home movies Purpuraet al found more bilateral HM and nger movements in infants who will later develop ASD Similarly several prospective followup studies of highrisk siblingsor retrospective studies on home moviesreported spe cic motor atypical repertoire in infants with ASDIn ASD early social signals have previously been assessed with automatized and computational proceduresfocusing on eye tracking at early stages vocal pro ductions analysis of acoustics of rst utterances or cry episodes but none was done in an interactive setting Our study proposed a paradigm shift from the assessmentof infant behavior to dyadic assessment of interactions aspreviously achieved in retrospective approaches usinghome movies The aim is not to implement studies of social signal processing in routine clinical work but ratherto decompose clinical intuitions and signs and validate the most relevant cues of these clinical features From clinical work back to clinics social signal processing is a rigorousstep to help clinicians better identify and assess earlytargets of interventions Given the exploratory nature of both our approach and method our results should be interpreted with cautiontaking into account strengths prospective followupautomatized multimodal social signal processing and ecological standardized assessment and limitations These limitations include the overall sample sizeknowing that WS is a rare disease the high rate ofmissing data during video recording due to the ecologicalconditions of the infant mother interaction mothers interposing between the camera and the infant the nal sample size of WS N that limited the power of machine learning methods We conclude that the method proposed here combining multimodal automatized assessment of social signal processing during early interaction with infants at risk forNDD is a promising tool to decipher clinical features thatremain dif cult to identify and assess In the context of WS we showed that such a method we proposed to labelbehavioral and interaction imaging was able to sig nicantly predict the development of ASD or ID at years of age in highrisk children who had WS and were assessed at months of age
