Psychology Shahid Beheshti University Tehran Iran Abstract The increase in the number of children with autism and the importance of early autism inter vention has prompted researchers to perform automatic and early autism screening Conse quently in the present paper a crybased screening approach for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD is introduced which would provide both early and automatic screening During the study we realized that ASD specific features are not necessarily observable in all children with ASD and in all instances collected from each child Therefore we proposed a new classification approach to be able to determine such features and their corresponding instances To test the proposed approach a set of data relating to children between to months which had been recorded using highquality voice recording devices and typical smartphones at various locations such as homes and daycares was studied Then after preprocessing the approach was used to train a classifier using data for boys with ASD and Typically Developed TD boys The trained classifier was tested on the data of boys and girls with ASD and TD boys and TD girls The sensi tivity specificity and precision of the proposed approach for boys were and respectively These measures were and for girls respec tively It was shown that the proposed approach outperforms the common classification methods Furthermore it demonstrated better results than the studies which used voice fea tures for screening ASD To pilot the practicality of the proposed approach for early autism screening the trained classifier was tested on participants between to months These participants consisted of boys and girls and the results were very encourag ing for the use of the approach in early ASD screening Introduction Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD are defined by their abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors interests or activities The rapid growth of ASD in the past years has inspired many research efforts toward the diagnosis and rehabilitation of ASD In the field of PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE v Harvard Dataverse Contains only a rar file of sounds DVNLSTBQW Funding HM received a small fund for collecting data and for diagnosing the subjects Grant number Cognitive Sciences and Technology Council of Iran cogcir The funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist Early screening of autism using cry features diagnosis there are several wellestablished manual methods to diagnose children over months However the practical average age of diagnosis is over years due to the lack of knowledge about ASD and the lack of expertise for diagnosing autism It is of the utmost importance to have early diagnosisscreening in order to provide early intervention which is more effective at the first few years of life than later on It is shown that early inter vention improves the developmental performance in children with ASD It has also been reported that early interventions would be cost saving for families and the treatment service systems Consequently there are two main questions can autism be screened earlier than months to reduce the typical diagnosis or intervention age and is it possible to employ intelligent methods for the screening of autism to eliminate the widespread need for experts It should be mentioned that our goal was to answer these questions with respect to screening all children who may not have clear symptoms The screened children should go through a diagnosis procedure to acquire confirmation andor be cautiously worked with Fortunately there are studies in the literature showing that the age of diagnosis can be lower than months For example Thabtah and Peebles reviewed several questionnaire based approaches that may be able to screen ASD above months of age However those approaches like Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised ADIR and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS which have been clinically proven to be effective and ade quate are timeconsuming instruments and need trained practitioners to use them To reduce the dependency on the human expertise needed in using such questionnaires sev eral studies proposed machine learning methods to classify children with ASD using questionnaires Their goal was to automate the process andor find an optimum subset of questions or features For instance Abbas et al proposed a multimodular assessment sys tem combined of three modules a parent questionnaire a clinician questionnaire and a video assessment module Although the authors used machine learning to automate and improve classification process the need for human involvement still exists in order to answer questions or assess videos On the other hand Emerson et al showed that fMRI can be used to predict the diagno sis of autism at the age of in highrisk monthold infants Denisova and Zhao used movement data from rsfMRI from monthold infants to predict future atypical develop mental trajectories as biological features Furthermore Bosl TagerFlusberg and Nelson suggested that useful biomarkers can be extracted from EEG signals for early detection of autism Bloodbased markers and prenatal immune markers were also proposed to diagnose ASD that can be used right after birth Although these approaches suggest new directions towards early ASD diagnosisscreening they are costly require expertness and dedi cated equipment which would limit their usage Furthermore these methods are still in the early stages of research and require further approval Finally approaches which involve meth ods such as fMRI or EEG are difficult to use on children especially on children with autism who may have trouble following instructions appropriately have atypical behaviors or have excessive head movements There are studies that used vocalizationbased analysis to screen children with autism For instance Brisson et al showed differences in voice features between children with ASD and Typically Developing TD children Several studies like used speechrelated features for the screening of children older than To reach the goal of early ASD screening vocaliza tions of infants under years of age have been investigated Santos et al used vocalizations such as babbling to screen ASD children at the age of months They collected data from and ASD and TD children respectively They reported high accuracy of around which can be due to the fact that they used kfold crossvalidation without consid ering subjectwise hold out in order to have unseen subjects in the test fold Oller et al PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features proposed another vocalizationbased classification method in which they included age and excluded crying They applied the method on TD children and children with ASD between to months and reached accuracy Pokorny et al extracted eGeMAPS parameter set which includes acoustic parameters in month old children This set consists of statistics calculated for frequencyrelated energyrelated and spectral lowlevel descriptors They reached a accuracy on a population of TD children and children with ASD Esposito Hiroi and Scattoni showed that crying is a promising biomarker for the screening of ASD children Sheinkopf et al and Orlandi et al have shown that there are differences in the cry of children with ASD compared to TD children To the best of our knowledge our own groups preliminary study was the only research that has used cry sounds for the screening of children with ASD We used a dataset of children with ASD and TD children older than two years The accuracy of the proposed method is using k fold cross validation without considering subjectwise hold out which is a shortcoming of this study In other words it has been overfitted to the available data and may fail to correctly clas sify new samples So a thorough examination using an unseen test set on cry features is neces sary to evaluate the results It should be noted that the data from our previous study could not be used in the study presented in this paper due to the differences in data collection procedures In all the above studies it was assumed that the specific sound features distinguishing chil dren with ASD from TD children are common among all the ASD cases However this may not be the case for all the features For instance tiptoe walking which is one of the repetitive behaviors of children with ASD appears in approximately of these children Conse quently in the current study we propose a new crybased approach for screening children with ASD Our screening approach makes use of the assumption that all discriminative charac teristics of autism may not appear in all ASD children This assumption is in contrast with the assumption put forward in the ordinary instancebased machine learning methods which assumes that all instances of a class include all discriminative features needed for classification In our proposed method at first discriminable instances of cries which exist in subsets of chil dren with ASD are found Then it uses these instances to select features to distinguish between these ASD instances from TD instances It should be mentioned that the final selected features in this study are common among our set of children with ASD between to months of age These selected features support the experiential knowledge of our experts stating that the variations in the cries of children with ASD are more than TD children This approach is dif ferent from the other approaches that either used a dataset of children with a specific age or used age information for classification The proposed approach has been imple mented and tested on participants The results show the effectiveness of the approach with respect to accuracy sensitivity and specificity Method Since this study was performed on human subjects first it was approved by the ethics commit tee at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services All the parents of the participants were informed about the study and signed an agreement form before being included in the study Participants There were participants aged between and months who were divided into two groups ie ASD and TD with boys and girls in each group Since we expected to PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features have different vocalization characteristics for boys and girls the training set was assembled of only boys including TD and ASD In other words we wanted to eliminate the gender effects on the feature extraction and model training Unfortunately due to the lower number of girls with ASD in the real world not enough data for girls with ASD could be collected Nonetheless the model was also tested on the girls to see how it would generalize even on them The inclusion criteria of the ASD participants were a being very recently diagnosed with ASD based on DSM with no other neurodevelopmental mental and intellectual disorder b having no other known medical or genetic conditions or environmental factors and c not having received any treatment or medication or having received treatment in less than a month There were only two girls who did not fall into these criteria since they had been diag nosed more than a year before The participants average language development at the time of participation which was assessed based on was equal to children between to months old The autism diagnosis procedure started with the Gilliam Autism Rating ScaleSec ond Edition GARS questionnaire which was answered by the parents Then the parents were interviewed based on DSM while the participants were evaluated and observed by two child clinical psychologists with PhD degrees In addition the diagnosis of ASD was separately confirmed by at least one child psychiatrist in a different setting It should be noted that ADOS which is a very common diagnostic tool is not administered widely in Iran since there is no official translation of ADOS in Farsi TD children were selected from those in an age range similar to the ASD participants from volunteer families from their homes and health centers They had no evidence or official diagnosis of any neurological or psychological disorder at the time of recording their voices The children with ASD were older than months with the mean standard deviation and range of and months respectively The TD children were younger than months with the mean standard devia tion and range of about and months respectively It should be mentioned that the diagnosis of the children under years was mainly based on experts evaluation not the GARS score Furthermore all TD participants under years of age had a follow up study when they passed the age of to make sure the initial TD assignment was correct or still valid To do so we used a set of expertselected questions based on to assess them through interviews with parents Tables and show the details of the participants on the training and test sets respectively In each table the number of voice instances from each participant and the total duration of all its instances in seconds are shown in columns and respectively The recording device cate gory ie a highquality recorder HQR and typical cell phones CP is given in the device cat egory

total number of samples for all children of the samples were from ASD participants and were from TD participants Two groups of TD and ASD children were selected for training the classifiers such that two groups were as balanced as possible with respect to age and the recording device Thus each child in the TD group had a corresponding child in the ASD group around the same age As a result of this data balancing we obtained training participants with an age between and months The mean ages in the training set were and months for ASD and TD participants respectively The standard deviations are

the last column of Table is based on the parental interviews and our experts evaluation Unfortu nately Child Child and Childs parents did not cooperate in obtaining expert evaluation Data collection and preprocessing As mentioned earlier the data was recorded using highquality devices and typical smart phones The highquality devices were a UX Sony voice recorder and a Sony UXF voice recorder To use typical smartphones a voicerecording and archiving application was devel oped and used on various types of smartphones All voices through the application or the highquality recorders were recorded in wav format bits and with the sampling rate of kHz The reason for using various devices was to avoid biasing of the approach to a spe cific device Similarly the place of recording was not restricted to one place in order to make the results applicable to all places The parents and trained voice collectors were asked to record the voices in a quiet environ ment Furthermore they were asked to keep the recorders or smartphones about cm from the participants mouth Despite the proposed two recommendations there were recorded PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Table The test set information ID Age month of

collection there was a preprocessing phase in which only pure crying parts of the recordings with no other types of vocalization were selected To explain more the parts of cry sounds which were accompanied by screaming saying wordsother vocalizations or that occurred with closednonempty mouth were eliminated All segmentations and eliminations were done manually using Sound Forge Pro From the selected cries the beginning and the end which contained voice rises and fades were removed in order to just keep the steady parts of the cries this prevents having too much variation in the voice which can lead to unsuitable statistics Also the uvularguttural parts of the cries were removed The reason for this was that we believe these parts distort the feature values of the steady parts of a voice Each remaining continuous segment of the cries was considered and used as a sample instance in this study Finally since the basic voice features were extracted from milliseconds frames to generate statistical features of the basic features the minimum length of the cry seg ments were set to frames ie milliseconds Thus any cry samples below millisec onds were eliminated from the study In this study the final prepared samples were between milliseconds to seconds Feature extraction Previous studies working on voice features for discriminating ASD children used different sets of features These methods share several common features like F ie the fundamental frequency of a voice and MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients MFCC ie coefficients which represent the shortterm power spectrum of a sound F has been one of the most common features used However since age is an important factor affecting F this feature is useful when participants have a similar age On the other hand MFCC coefficients and several related statistical values have been reported to be useful features in several studies Consider ing the useful features reported in previous studies and the specifications of the current study several features were selected to be used in this work that are explained in the following In this study each instance was divided into milliseconds frames to extract basic voice features We used several features proposed by Motlagh Moradi and Pouretemad and by BelalcazarBolaos et al The features used by Motlagh Moradi and Pouretemad include certain statistics like mean and covariance of the framewise basic features such as MFCC coefficients over a voice segment They also used the mean and variance of framewise temporal derivative of the basic features The framewise temporal derivative means PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features the difference between two consecutive frames which in a sense is the rate of change of a fea ture value in one frame step We modified the spectral flatness features by including the range of Hz beside the Hz range This range was added to cover a wider frequency range than the normal children frequency range which showed to be necessary in the process of feature extraction and selection Each range is divided into octaves and the spectral flatness is computed for those octaves We removed all uninformative and noisy features of the set which are explained in the fol lowing The mean of framewise temporal derivative of the basic features is removed because it is not a meaningful feature and is equal to taking the difference between the value of the last and the first frames There are means of the features related to the energy such as the audio power total loudness SONE and the first coefficient of MFCC that were removed to make the classifier independent of the loudnesspower in childrens voices Zero crossing rate ZCR was omitted too due to its dependency on the noise in the environment The second set of features used in this study was from BelalcazarBolaos et al because it has phonation features like jitter and shimmer Jitter and shimmer which have been reported to be discriminative for ASD are linked to perceptions of breathiness hoarseness and rough ness Other features used from BelalcazarBolaos et al include glottal features related to vocal quality and the closing velocity of the vocal folds The mean of logarithmic energy feature was omitted for the same reason as other energyrelated features A summary of the fea tures added to or removed from the sets by and is presented in Table The proposed subset instance classifier To explain the proposed classifier it was assumed that there is a target group of participants that we want to distinguish from the rest of the participants called the rest Furthermore each participant in the target group may have several instances that may be used to distinguish the target group from the rest Fig A shows a situation in which all instances of all participants of the target group are differentiable using common classifiers that we call Whole Set Instance WSI classifiers In this figure the circles represent our target group and the triangles represent the rest The color coding is used to differentiate between the instances of each participant in each group In contrast to the situation in Fig A in Fig B the target group cannot easily be dis tinguished from the rest In such a situation there are instances of two participants in the target group ie the red and brown circles that are not easily separable from the instances in the rest Case Furthermore there is a participant with no instances ie the orange circles easily Table The features and statistics which were added or removed to the two feature sets Feature removingadding Reason Second set logarithmic energy Mean statistic is removed Classification dependency on loudnesspower of cries First set Audio power Total

added Covering the lowfrequency range of human voice PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features separable from the rest Case An example of Case is tiptoe walking in children with ASD which is common in about of these children who do it most of the time An example of Case is children with ASD who do not tiptoe walk In other words there are children with ASD who cannot be distinguished from TD children using the tiptoe walking behavior factor Applying any WSI classifier may fail for the data type shown in Fig B Consequently we proposed SubSet Instance SSI classifier that first finds differentiable instances and then trains a classifier on these instances As an example the proposed SSI classifier first tries to find the circles on the left of the line in Fig B using a clustering method Then it uses these circles as exclusive instances having a specific feature common in a subset of the target group to train a classifier separating a subset of the target group The steps of common WSI classifiers are shown in Fig A The steps of our proposed SSI classifier are shown in Fig B In the SSI classification approach after the feature extraction and clustering steps for each cluster a classifier is trained to separate its exclusive instances from the instances of the rest of the participants In the testing phase any participant with only one instance classified in the target group positive instance is classified as a target groups participant The pseudocode for the proposed approach is given in Algorithms and Algorithm Training SSI classifiers T set of all target group instances R set of all the rest instances F set of all classifiers threshold for the number of samples in a cluster s the number of minimum samples needed in a

the target group participants instances are distinguishable using a classifier In b only some instances of the target group participants are separable from the other instances by a classifier PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features Fig An overall view of WSI and SSI methods a In WSI method after feature extraction a classifier is trained on all instances and majority pooling MP is usually used in the testing phase In this study Bestchance threshold Pooling BP which is a thresholdbased pooling with the threshold giving the best accuracy on the test set is also used to give the best chance to WSI classifier b In the proposed SSI classifier after feature extraction clustering is applied to find and select exclusive instances containing instances of the target

proposed training algorithm of the SSI approach the goal is to find clusters contain ing the ASD instances only Then a classifier is trained using the instances of these clusters and PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features added to a list of all trained classifiers lines and of Algorithm As shown in the loop of the algorithm starting at line the data is clustered starting with two clusters Then the num ber of clusters is increased until a cluster containing only the target group instances emerges The exclusive instances in such a cluster are removed from the set of all target groups instances and the loop is restarted Before restarting the loop if the number of instances in this cluster is more than a threshold a new classifier using these instances is trained and this classifier is added to the set of all trained classifiers The loop stops when the number of sam ples in each cluster is less than a threshold For testing the participants using the trained classifiers all the instances of each participant are classified one by one using all the trained classifiers line of Algorithm A subject would be classified in the target group if at least one of its instances is classified in the target group at least by one of the classifiers lines and of Algorithm Otherwise if there is no instance classified among the target group the participant is classified as the rest lines and Details of the implementations The classifiers were implemented in Python using scikitlearn library WSI classifiers We have tested several common WSI classifiers but we report only the result of SVM with RBF kernel and with no feature selection which gives the best average accuracy It should be noted that several feature selection approaches like LSVM and back ward elimination were tested but they only reduced the accuracy We used group fold cross validation for tuning hyperparameters Group Kfold means that all instances of each partici pant are placed in only one of the folds This prevents having the same participants instances in the train and validation folds simultaneously In each fold there were two ASD and two TD participants It should be mentioned that before applying the algorithms we balanced the number of instances of the two groups using upsampling Two approaches were exploited to combine the decisions on different samples of a partici pant in the WSI approach The first approach was majority pooling which classifies a partici pant as ASD if the number of instances classified as ASD are more than percent of all instances The second approach was thresholdbased pooling which is similar to the first approach except that a threshold other than is used SSI classifiers Before applying the algorithm we balanced the number of instances of the two groups by upsampling The threshold for the minimum number of samples needed in a cluster to be able to train a classifier is set to It should be mentioned that agglomerative clustering and decision tree are the methods used for clustering and classification parts of Algorithm respectively Training the SSI classifiers After running Algorithm on our data two exclusive clus ters with enough instances ie at least instances in our study were found Then two classifi ers were trained corresponding to each cluster One of these exclusive clusters had instances from ASD participants Table These instances consisted of out of instances of ASD out of instances of ASD out of instances of ASD and out of instances of ASD As explained in the algorithm for each cluster a decision tree classifier was trained using the ASD instances in the cluster versus all TD instances Interestingly only one feature was enough to discriminate instances in the cluster from all TD instances Among those features that can discriminate the clusters instances we selected the Variance of Frame wise Temporal Derivative VFTD of the th MFCC coefficient as the feature which can dis criminate more ASD participants from the set of all participants with a simple threshold The classifier obtained by setting a threshold based on this feature was the first classifier This fea ture supports our experts report regarding the higher variations in the cry sounds of ASD PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features children than TD children From ASD children of them can be discriminated using this feature For each participant the number of instances found by this classifier is shown in the nd column of Table After excluding the ASD samples from the first classifier the second classifier was trained based on the second exclusive cluster This cluster included all instances of participant ASD The only feature used for classifying this cluster was VFTD of the th SONE coefficient SONE is a unit of loudness which is a subjective perception of sound pressure Having higher VFTD of the th SONE coefficient confirms the experiential knowledge of our experts men tioned before Among all the ASD participants eight had instances with VFTD of the th SONE higher than a threshold Shown in the rd column of Table The results of classifica tion based on these two features are depicted in Fig As mentioned in the proposed method section the participants with at least one instance classified into this cluster would be consid ered as a participant with ASD Results In this part the performance of our proposed SSI classifier against a common WSI classifier is evaluated on our test set of ASD and TD participants Each participant has multiple instances which are cleaned using the criteria explained in the data collection and preprocessing section The participants who had at least one accepted instance were used in the training and testing phases which are shown in Tables and The output of the SSI approach was two classifiers each of them works by setting a thresh old based on a feature The number of instances of ASD participants in the training set cor rectly detected by the first and the second classifiers are shown in the second and third columns of Table respectively On the other hand the bestresulting classifier for the WSI approach was Radial Basis FunctionSupport Vector Machine RBFSVM The classification results on the test set for different classifiers are shown in Table The portion of each participants instances correctly classified by each classifier is written as a percentage under the name of the classifier The decision made by the WSI and SSI classifi ers for each participant is shown by ASD or TD To classify each subject using

twodimensional scatter plot of the two features used in C and C classifiers are shown in Fig As can be seen in this figure the instances of a participant with ASD are scattered in the area containing instances of both TD and ASD participants Nevertheless there are instances for this participant uniquely distinguishable using the selected two features We compared the results of our proposed method with that of the only method available in the literature which was trained using only cry features based on our data The results Table show the superiority of our method compared to the previously

scattered in the space of two features given by the proposed SSI method The instances of a chosen ASD participant are illustrated in green to show that a participant may have instances in the area common with TD instances besides those two areas separated by the selected thresholds as ASD The mentioned ASD participant with green instances is tagged as ASD due to having at least one instance with the greater value than at least one of the thresholds on the two features Discussion and conclusion In this paper we presented a novel crybased screening method to distinguish between chil dren with autism and typically developing children In the proposed method groups of chil dren with autism who have specific features in their cry sounds can be determined This method is based on a new classification approach called SubSet Instance SSI classifier An appealing property of the proposed SSI classifier in the case of voicebased autism screening is its high specificity such that a normal child can be detected with no error We applied the proposed method on a group of participants consisting of boys with ASD between and Table Comparison of the results on the test set using the two

Classification of the participants under months using our trained SSI classifier Classified as ASD Classified as TD ASD a Other developmental or mental disorders Boys TD Othersa ASD Girls TD Othersa months of age and TD boys between and months of age The two features found in this study were used to train a classifier on boys with ASD and TD boys Then the classifier was used to distinguish boys with ASD from TD boys reaching accuracy Due to the fact that girls are less likely to have autism and consequently it is harder to collect enough data from girls than boys the number of girls with ASD was not sufficient to train a separate classifier for this gender It should be noted that we tested the trained system on girls with ASD and TD girls It was seen that the trained classifier can screen girls with lower accuracy than boys of the test set In other words it seems that gender differences should be considered in the training of the system In testing the data from participants under months one TD girl was classified as ASD which was not the case for any TD children of the male counterparts This result also confirms the aforementioned point about the gender effect However in future work we would try to collect more data on girls to be able to train a system to accurately screen girls Furthermore we would also try to train a single classifier for boys and girls to determine whether it can be used for both of them It should be mentioned that our training and test data were completely separate to make the trained model more general The features found in this study are applicable in the age range of our participants from to months This is in contrast to other approaches that either used a dataset of children with a specific age or used age information for classifi cation Due to the age invariant features found in this study it can be claimed that there are markers in the voices of children with ASD that are sustained at least in a range of ages The two discriminative features found in this study were a coefficient of MFCC and a SONE coefficient MFCC and SONE are related to the power spectrum of a speech signal SONE mea sures loudness in specific Bark bands On the other hand MFCC which is the inverse DFT of logspectrum in the Mel scale is related to the timbre of the voice Therefore MFCC and SONE can be interpreted to be related to the timbre and loudness of a tone Furthermore based on the feedback from our experts there is unpredictability in the crying sound of children with autism which is not the case for TD children Consequently we used the variance of temporal difference as a feature suitable for screening children with autism This is due to the fact that if a signal is constant or changes linearly over time the variance of temporal difference is zero Therefore the variance of temporal difference can be seen as the amount of ambiguity or unpre dictability of a sound On the other hand the heightened variability in the two features found in this study for children with ASD is significant due to the reports from other studies which shows increased biological signals variability in children with ASD and infants at high risk for autism in comparison with TD children These features are statistical features of the cry instances that hold constant at least across an age range studied in this research To the best of our knowledge and were the only studies on screening children with autism using voice features on children younger than years of age Our proposed method has higher precision than these two ie more than and more than using only cry features The use of cry features as suitable biomarkers for autism screening matches the claims in PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features In the present study only children with ASD and TD children were tested Other develop mental disorders or health issues were not tested to see how children with such disorders would be classified using the proposed method which can decrease the specificity of However this approach is proposed to be used as a screening tool and the final diagnosis should be done under experts supervision So this approach can be applied as a general screener of autism spectrum disorder The trained classifier was also tested on participants between to months of age The classifier screened two boys from the rest ie Child and Child Table Child showed evi dences of genetic disease and was diagnosed with developmental delay and Child received UNDD classification by our experts This suggests that a the system can be used for children under years of age and b it may be able to distinguish other neurodevelopmental disorders On the other hand there were boys ie Child to Child Table who had no evidence of mental or developmental disorders at the time of their recording At the same time our approach did not distinguish them as children with ASD either However when they were older than years they showed symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders Out of these children we could manage to collect new recordings from Child and Child that were classified as children with ASD using our approach Unfortunately Child Child and Child did not cooperate and could not be evaluated by an expert to validate the results of our expertselected questionnaire Furthermore the parents refused to cooperate send us their childrens recent cry sounds The result of studying these children under the age of months may suggest that a there could be symptoms in the crying sounds of children with neurodevelopmental disorders under months Child and Child b the approach may not be able to screen a participant with neurodevelopmental disorders under the age of months due to the possibility that the participant was among those children with neurodevelopmental disorders who do not have our proposed specific features in their crying sounds the participants recorded cry samples did not include our specific features andor neurodevelopmental disorders and their features had not been developed in the child at the time of initial recording The reason behind not classifying Child and Child as children with ASD under the age of could be b or b To clearly determine any reason behind this phenomena a further investigation is needed We believe that this approach can be used to perform early autism screening under months of age Thus in the future we need to collect data and test the approach on more data of children under months to validate these results with more confidence We have to further check the proposed approach and the extracted features on other neuro developmental disorders such as ADHD to evaluate the capability of the approach to distin guish the children with these disorders from TD children Furthermore without comparing the cry sounds of children with ASD to those without ASD but another disorder we do not really know if these findings are specific to autism or to general atypical brain developments Thus we should collect cry sounds of children with other neurodevelopmental disorders and compare voices of children with ASD to voices of children with other neurodevelopmental disorders to see if these features would be able to separate them or not It has been demonstrated that crying consists of intricate motor activities On the other hand it has been shown that children with ASD have problems in the motor domain and in coordination of their motor capabilities with other modalities Consequently it is possible that the extracted features in the crying sounds of children with ASD come from this defi ciencyproblem in the motor domain which requires further investigations Finally automating the preprocessing part is a technical issue that should be addressed if it is deemed necessary that the crybased screening be fully automated This is important since PLOS ONE December PLOS ONE Early screening of autism using cry features such a screening system can be deployed in systems such as Amazon Alexa to automati cally screen problematic cry sounds Acknowledgments We would like to thank the Center for Treatment of Autism Disorder CTAD
