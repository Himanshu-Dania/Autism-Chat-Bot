Scientific RepoRtS Ai Approach to Streamline Autism Diagnosis in Young children Halim Abbas ford Garberson Stuart LiuMayo eric Glover Dennis p Wall Autism has become a pressing healthcare challenge the instruments used to aid diagnosis are time and labor expensive and require trained clinicians to administer leading to long wait times for atrisk children We present a multimodular machine learningbased assessment of autism comprising three complementary modules for a unified outcome of diagnosticgrade reliability A minute parentreport questionnaire delivered via a mobile app a list of key behaviors identified from minute semistructured home videos of children and a minute questionnaire presented to the clinician at the time of clinical assessment We demonstrate the assessment reliability in a blinded multisite clinical study on children months of age n in the United States It outperforms baseline screeners administered to children by CI to in AUC and CI to in specificity when operating at sensitivity Compared to the baseline screeners evaluated on children less than months of age our assessment outperforms the most accurate by CI to at in AUC and CI to in specificity when operating at sensitivity Idiopathic forms of Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD have no known biological cause and may correspond to multiple conditions with similar symptoms The incidence of ASD has increased in recent years and it impacts in children according to the latest studies ASD is diagnosed from clinical observations according to standard criteria relating to the childs social and behavioral symptoms Autism is said to be on a spectrum due to the varied severities of symptoms ranging from relatively mild social impairment to debilitating intellectual disabilities inabilities to change routines and severe sensory reactions Approximately of autistic children are nonverbal and have severe symptoms Notably diagnosis within the first few years of life dramatically improves the outlook of children with autism as it allows for treatment during a key window of developmental plasticity Unfortunately the latest studies show that although of parents of children with autism reported developmental concerns about their children by months of age the median age of diagnosis in the United States is months The complexity of the diagnostic procedures and the shortage of trained specialists can result in children with ASD not getting a diagnosis early enough to receive behavioral therapies during the time when they are most effective Diagnosing autism in the United States generally takes two steps developmental screening followed by com prehensive diagnostic evaluation if screened positive Screening instruments typically use questionnaires that are answered by a parent teacher or clinician They are generally easy and inexpensive to administer and can be useful to flag some atrisk children however they are not always accurate enough to help inform a diagnosis Standard autism screeners can also have a high false positive rate leading to unnecessary referrals and healthcare costs Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation instruments on the other hand are more accurate but require long and expensive interactions with highly trained clinicians In this paper we present improvements to two previously published automated autism assessment modules underlying the Cognoa software The first module is based on a brief questionnaire about the child presented directly to parents without supervision The second module is based on lightly trained analysts evaluating short videos of children within their natural environment that are captured by parents using a mobile device We also present a new third module that is intended to be completed in a primary care setting such as a pediatricians office during a clinic visit The third module is based upon a questionnaire that is answered by a clinician after examining the child and talking to the parent We demonstrate that these three modules are as fast and easy to Cognoa Inc Palo Alto CA USA Departments of Pediatrics Biomedical Data Science and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Stanford University Stanford CA USA email Scientific RepoRtS as most of the typical screening instruments yet their combined assessment accuracy is shown in this work to be significantly higher such that they may be used to aid in diagnosis of autism We present our approach to selecting maximally predictive features for each of the modules Both the parent and the clinician questionnaire modules key on behavioral patterns similar to those probed by a standard autism diagnostic instrument the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised ADIR ADIR is administered by a trained clinician and typically gives consistent results across examiners But its point questionnaire often spanning hours of the interviewer and parents time makes it largely impractical for the primary care setting The video assessment module keys on behavioral patterns similar to those probed in another diagnostic instrument the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS ADOS is a multimodular diagnostic instrument with different modules for subjects at different levels of cognitive development It is widely considered a gold standard and is one of the most common behavioral instruments used to aid in the diagnosis of autism It consists of an interactive and structured examination of the child by trained clinicians in a tightly controlled setting For validation the three modules are applied to assess children in a clinical study using the Cognoa software Todate Cognoa has been used by over parents in the US and internationally The majority of Cognoa users are parents of young children between and months The clinical study underlying the validation results discussed in the results section consists of a total of atrisk children who had undergone full clinical examination and received a clinical diagnosis at a center specialized in neurodevelopmental disorders The outputs of the assessment modules are compared to those of three screening instruments The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised MCHATR is a parentcompleted questionnaire for autism that is intended to be administered during developmental screenings for children between the ages of and months and is commonly used as an autism screening instrument The Social Responsiveness Scale Second Edition SRS is another standard ASD screener that is based upon a questionnaire filled out by an examiner The SRS has a preschool form intended for children of ages months to months and a school age form intended for children of ages months through years of age We use SRS total score scale as a baseline autism assessment The Child Behavior Checklist CBCL is a parentcompleted questionnaire that provides risk assessments in many categories We use the Autism Spectrum Problems scale of CBCL for comparison In all cases the answers to the questions comprising the screeners are coded then the codes are summed and the sum compared against a threshold to determine whether the child is at risk Methods We base our approach on deidentified historical patient records We collect medical instrument score sheet data pertaining to children tested for suspicion of autism and process those into training sets for the predictive models underlying each of our three autism assessment modules Since we apply said predictive models in a significantly different setting than the clinics where the correspond ing training data were generated we expect a consequential performance degradation resulting in unacceptable diagnostic accuracy if conventional machine learning methods are used To counteract that effect we apply custom machine learning techniques as detailed in this section building upon previous experimental work The new techniques discussed below are empirical posthoc feature selection training data noise injection and an overfittingresilient probabilistic combination of module outcomes Data Training data were compiled from multiple repositories of deidentified ADOS and ADIR score sheets of children between and months of age including Boston Autism Consortium Autism Genetic Resource Exchange Autism Treatment Network Simons Simplex Collection and Vanderbilt Medical Center To counteract class imbalance the sample set negative class was supplemented with low risk children randomsampled from Cognoas userbase and ADIR was administered on those additional controls The diagnostic accuracy of our modules was measured using data from a multisite blinded clinical validation study reviewed and approved by Western IRB project number The study was performed in and at three tertiary care centers in the United States Informed consent was obtained from guardians of each child and all relevant regulations and guidelines were followed Children enrolled in the study were to months of age of Englishspeaking households and were all referred through the typical referral process for suspicion of autism Every child was measured using autism assessment instruments such as ADOS MCHATR andor CBCL as appropriate for his or her age Diagnosis was ultimately ascertained by a licensed health care provider Prior to the clinical assessment parents used the Cognoa mobile app to complete the parent questionnaire and video assessment modules and starting in a clinician also completed the Cognoa clinician questionnaire The clinicians were blinded to the results of the assessment rendered by Cognoa More details on the steps of the clinical study are shown in Fig The enrollment process in yielded validation samples which were used to validate the parent ques tionnaire and video modules This same clinical enrollment cohort was used as validation dataset in our previous publication on the subject Given the learnings from this dataset and prior to the extension of the study in several improvements were made to the algorithms including tuning of model thresholds training combination modules and performing feature selection for the clinician module which was newly introduced in The enrollment process in yielded additional validation participants bringing the total N to samples over the course of the two years The sample breakdown by cohort age group and diagnosis for all data used for training and validation is shown in Table In both the training and the validation datasets the majority of the Not autism class label is composed mostly of children who are diagnosed with an alternate developmental delay eg ADHD or speech and language disorder Since these conditions share many symptoms with autism this is a particularly challenging sample for classification Only seven of the children in the validation sample are neurotypical suggesting that this sample will be harder to perform correct classifications on than in the general population Scientific RepoRtS methodology In this section we explain important aspects of our machine learning methodol ogy that are common to the classifiers underlying each of our three assessment modules Training procedure Classifier training feature selection and optimization were done separately for children under four years of age and four years of age and over The parent questionnaire and clinician questionnaire clas sifiers make predictions based off of answers to questions that probe similar concepts to the ADIR questionnaire They were trained using the answers to questions from historical itemlevel ADIR score sheets with labels corresponding to established clinical diagnoses The video module makes predictions based off of answers to questions that probe similar concepts to the ADOS instrument as recorded by video analysts It was trained using ADOS instrument score sheets and diagnostic labels Progressive sampling was used to verify sufficient training volume as detailed in the supplementary materials Gradient boosted decision trees were used for all three modules as they consistently performed better than other options that were considered such as neural networks support vector machines and logistic regression For all models hyperparameters were tuned with a bootstrapped grid search In all cases true class labels ASD or nonASD were used to stratify the folds and age label pairs were used to weightbalance the samples More details can be found in the supplementary materials In all cases the machine learning models were trained using historical patient records that correspond to con trolled clinical examinations but focused on application in nonclinical settings aimed for brevity easeofuse andor unsupervised parent usage at home These differences introduce biases which can be significant enough to ruin the performance of an algorithm if not properly addressed and which cannot be probed by cross validation See the supplementary material for further details New strategies to address these biases are discussed below that result in big improvements in accuracy compared to previous work Figure Detailed steps performed during the clinical study described in this document Age years ConditionNumber of samples ParentClinician module trainingVideo module trainingClinical validation Clinical validation Autism Not autism Autism Not autism Table Dataset breakdown by age group and condition for each of the sources of training data and for the clinical validation sample Machine learning model training was stratified by age group Clinical validation and samples are used together to evaluate performance of the parent and video modules in this paper while the clinician module was only available for the clinical dataset Scientific RepoRtS outcomes Each of the three modules predicts one of three assessment outcomes Positive negative and inconclusive As outlined in Fig support for inconclusive determination is incorporated using a process that involves three separate machine learning training runs The first model is trained to make predictions that are used to label the samples in the training data that are the most likely to be misclassified A second model is then trained using these labels to predict the likelihood of any new samples being misclassified Finally only samples that are likely to be classified correctly are used to train a final binary autism classifier Only the latter two models are used at prediction time the one to identify and filter out samples that should be labeled inconclusive and the other to make a binary prediction of whether the child is autistic in those which are likely to be correctly labeled More details about how these models are trained are available in the supplementary material parental module Initial feature selection The parental questionnaire probes for a minimal set of highly relevant child behavioral patterns that are maximally predictive of autism in combination Care is taken to phrase the questions and answers such that the most reliable signal can be input from everyday parents undertaking the questionnaire via mobile app without clinical assistance To that effect a custom feature selection method is devised involving robust bootstrapdriven backwards subtraction the details of which are discussed in a previous publication Out of an initial set of questions under consideration this produces an optimal set of novel questions for children less than four years old and questions for children four and older Empirical posthoc feature selection refinement Following the conclusion of the clinical validation study enrollment we studied differences in the distribution of answers to each question between the training data and the validation data that was collected in the clinical study While some questions had quite good agreement others show a strong bias towards higher or lower severity answer choices in the clinical data than in the training data Questions for which the mean absolute severity difference was statistically greater than three standard errors averaged over the autism and the nonautism samples are rejected This requirement results in the exclusion of out of the questions in the younger cohort and out of questions in the older cohort and the models are retrained with new hyperparameter tuning on the reduced feature set This further refinement of the selected features minimizes the significant biases due to differences between the training and application environment See the supplementary material for more details on these differences This feature refinement leads to a larger boost in performance compared with than any other improvement The size of the performance improvement is validated on the heldout sample of children collected during where the new models show a statistically equivalent increase in performance compared with the sample Video module The video assessment module consists of a parent upload of or mobile videos each to minutes in length of the child during play or meal time at home The underlying algorithm produces autism assessments based upon the responses of at least three minimallytrained analysts who watch the videos and then respond to a behavioral questionnaire The data available for training the video modules classification model are taken from ADOS sessions admin istered by clinicians in standardized clinical settings Gradient boosted decision trees are trained keying off of the features identified in the analysis of ADOS records The questionnaires that the video analysts answer are then created to probe for similar behavioral features as those observed in the training data A challenge of this methodology is that the module must make predictions in the face of missing features that are not observable in the short videos uploaded by the parents The video analysts are allowed to skip any questions if not answerable based on Figure An illustration of the methodology for training diagnostic assessment algorithms capable of outputting one of three possible outcomes positive negative or inconclusive The first binary classifier is only used to assist in training and never at runtime It is trained to predict binary autism vs not autism and these labels are then compared with the true ASD results to label which samples are incorrectly classified The samples with their correct and incorrect labels are used to train the classifiers at runtime A indeterminate classifier is trained to predict which samples will have their ASD diagnosis misclassified which serves as a filter to identify inconclusive cases at runtime while only the predicted correct samples are used to train the final binary ASD diagnosis classifier Scientific RepoRtS posted videos On average analysts skipped questions of the time with big variations among particular questions This effect combined with the large discrepancy in the observation time window from the original clinical examination to the brief homevideo version would result in a big assessmentaccuracy degradation unless steps are taken to correct for the bias and variance We tackle this problem by introducing bias and variance to the training data in a manner designed to make it statis tically similar to the video analyst answers on which the assessments will be run The data from the clinical study is used to develop this methodology and the performance of the algorithm on the data from the children enrolled in is used to validate the generalizability of the improvements Most children who participated in the clinical study are also administered a full ADOS which provided paired ADOS and video data that we use to determine what noise patterns to add Using these paired data we construct a probability map for each questionresponse set describing the ways video analysts are likely to respond for a given true ADOS response We then use the mapping as a stochastic transform to build a new training data set that can be thought of as the results of a hypothetical experiment in which the technicians watch parentsupplied video of the children in the training data and respond accordingly The addition of simulated setting noise to the classifier training data leads to a larger boost in performance compared with than any other improvement Additionally the optimal parameters for the resulting decision tree models favor larger tree depth This is as expected since the new models are expected to make determina tions as to which features are reliable when present as well as which features to fall back on when the best features are missing clinician module We introduce a module to screen for autism using questionnaire responses from a cli nician A pediatrician might answer these questions during a regular checkup The questions for the clinician were selected in a similar manner as used for the Parental Module see the supplementary material for details Responses from both the parent and the clinician are used in a machine learning module in the same manner as described for the parental questionnaire above Some key behaviors are probed via questions directed at both the parent and the clinician but the clinician questions are more nuanced and allow for more subtle answer choices In cases where the parent and the clinician give contradictory answers to the same question the clinicians answer overrides that of the parent The clinician module was introduced to the clinical validation study beginning in Its results are therefore based on a smaller sample size than those of the other modules Feature selection In order to create a brief clinician questionnaire appropriate for the primary care setting multiple lists of candidate questions are each compiled and ordered using different strategies The lists are then intersected and prioritized then the top features in the intersection set are shortlisted The first list of candidate questions is prepared by considering those questions from the original medical instruments that had been excluded from the parental questionnaire because they were deemed too difficult for a parent to answer reliably This list is ranked by feature importance values as measured and ranked by a dedicated offline machine learning training and cross validation run in the same manner as performed for initial parental module feature selection The second list is prepared from the parental questionnaire questions by simulating the effects of parents over or underestimating answer severities on children with machine learning responses near a decision threshold Children in the training data for whom the model response was between and above the ASDvsnon ASD decision threshold had their question severities dropped one at a time by one severity value while children who were between and below the decision threshold had their question severities raised by one severity category The questions in this list are then ranked based upon the average size of the resulting shift in model responses The procedure is repeated for children in the training data between and above or below the decision threshold In each case the top questions are selected with significant overlap This results to a total of candidate questions for young children and for older children The third list is prepared by consulting domain experts for an assessment of the likelihood of each candidate question to benefit from a clinicians input as a complement to the parents input This method is conducted separately for each of the two agesilo groups and results in an overall clinician questionnaire of questions for children through month old and questions for children to six years old Module combination Due to limitations on available training data it is not possible to train a single combined model that uses the input features from each of the parental video and clinician modules Instead responses from the modules are each considered to be a probability and combined mathematically using the equation rI RI I combTT Where rcomb is the result of the combination I is a vector of s R is a vector of responses for each module to be combined and is the covariance matrix of the response residuals compared to the true diagnosis The training of the combination module consists of calculating the values of to use in this equation which is done using the responses of each module on data from the clinical study For each child the values in the rcomb equation were calculated with that child excluded This process is similar to leaveoneout cross validation and ensures that the results reported for our combination procedure do not suffer from overfitting Since Eq produces only a single model response the determination of inconclusive outcomes proceeds in a different manner than for the individual assessment modules Both a lower and an upper threshold are applied on the combined response Children with a response less than both thresholds are considered to be nonASD children with a response in between the two thresholds are considered to be inconclusive and children with a response greater than both thresholds are considered to have ASD As in the single model cases the two thresholds can be tuned independently to optimize the sensitivity specificity and model coverage Scientific RepoRtS Each of the individual Cognoa assessment modules their combinations as well as baselines based on commonlyused autism screening instruments CBCL MCHATR and SRS are evaluated on the data collected during a blinded clinical study When the inconclusive determination feature is turned off and all samples are required to be assessed conclusively the Cognoa assessment modules achieve ROC AUC up to and sensitivity and specificity up to and respectively Turning on the inconclusive determination feature with an allowance of up to inconclusive outcomes results in an accuracy improvement over the conclusive samples with AUC up to with sensitivity and specificity up to and respectively This performance is shown to be a statistically significant improvement over each of the baselines used for comparison ROC curves in Fig show how the parent module performs individually as well as in combination with the video and clinician modules at a inconclusive rate allowance Figure shows a similar comparison with all the variants consistently restricted to children under four years of age ROC curves corresponding to the assessment modules with the inconclusive allowance turned off can be found in the supplementary material Statistical model performance comparisons between assessment modules and baselines are shown in Table For each comparison the subset of children for whom both screeners were administered are selected n in the table and bootstrapping experiments are run where n children are selected with replacement The average and confidence interval improvements in AUC and the specificity between the screeners are evaluated across all bootstrapping experiments In the case of specificity the calculation of the improvement is performed using thresholds that are set to achieve sensitivity Table shows that Cognoa modules show an improvement of at least in AUC and at least in spec ificity compared with the CBCL and SRS screeners at confidence level Due to the fact that MCHATR screener is only evaluated on younger children the statistical uncertainty in the comparison is larger however it also shows an improvement of at least in AUC and in specificity at confidence level In these comparisons we allow Cognoa assessment modules to decide to hold aside up to of the hardest cases as inconclusive The same comparisons when we force the classification on all of the hardest cases can be found in Table of the supplementary material Figure ROC curves on the clinical sample for the parent video and clinician modules separately and in combination Inconclusive determination is allowed for up to of the cases The established screening tools MCHATR SRS and CBCL are compared as baselines The ROC curve for the MCHATR baseline instrument only includes children under four years of age since MCHATR is not applicable for older children Figure ROC curves on kids years of age in the clinical sample for the parent video and clinician modules separately and in combination Inconclusive determination is allowed for up to of the cases The established screening tools MCHATR SRS and CBCL are compared as baselines Scientific RepoRtS to completion comparisons A random sample of Cognoa users was used in order to measure time to completion of each of the Cognoa autism assessment modules The median time to completion of the parent module was just under minutes The median time to completion of the clinician module was minutes The median time per video analysts to score a videos was minutes More details can be found in the supplementary material The results indicate that the parent and clinician modules can be completed in as little time as most established autism screeners and in some cases much faster while achieving significantly higher accuracy The time required for a video analyst to score a video is more lengthy however the turnaround time is faster than for an ADOS administration and can be performed by minimally trained analysts as opposed to certified clinical practitioners Discussion We presented a multimodular assessment consisting of three machine learning modules for the identification of autism via mobile App as well as an evaluation of their performance and timetocompletion in a blinded clinical study The assessment modules outperform conventional autism screeners as shown in Table and Fig The accuracy of the combined assessment is similar to that of goldstandard instruments such as ADOS and ADIR without requiring hours of time from certified clinical practitioners This suggests the potential for the Cognoa assessment to be useful as an autism diagnostic The high performance of these modules benefits from the use of the techniques described in this paper to identify and set aside up to of the most challenging samples as inconclusive The supplementary material of this paper shows that we outperform conventional autism screeners without this technique as well Important open questions remain First in all cases in this paper the assessment modules were validated on children who had been preselected as having high risk of autism Children that are preselected in this way tend to have autismlike characteristics regardless of their true diagnosis increasing the challenge of distinguishing true ASD cases These modules are expected to perform better on a general population sample of children Further work is needed to verify this hypothesis by conducting clinical studies on children from the general population Second the clinician module newly presented in this work appears promising but so far it has only been applied in a secondarycare setting Further testing in primary care clinics is needed to validate accuracy in that setting In addition two wider avenues of exploration are interesting as further steps First while these assessment mod ules have been shown to be effective at identifying the presence or absence of autism our goal is to extend them to identify the severity of the condition if present as well Second the techniques presented in this paper could potentially be used to build algorithms for other child behavioral conditions than autism as well as behavioral conditions affecting adults and
