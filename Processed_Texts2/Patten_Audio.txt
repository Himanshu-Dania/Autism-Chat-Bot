Vocal patterns in infants with Autism Spectrum Disorder Canonical babbling status and vocalization frequency Elena Patten PhD Katie Belardi MS Grace T Baranek PhD Linda R Watson EdD Jeffrey D Labban PhD and D Kimbrough Oller PhD Univ of North Carolina Greensboro Univ of North Carolina Chapel Hill Univ of Memphis and Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research Klosterneuburg Austria Abstract Canonical babbling is a critical milestone for speech development and is usually well in place by months The possibility that infants with ASD show late onset of canonical babbling has so far eluded evaluation Rate of vocalization or volubility has also been suggested as possibly aberrant in infants with ASD We conducted a retrospective video study examining vocalizations of infants at and months Twentythree of the infants were later diagnosed with ASD and indeed produced low rates of canonical babbling and low volubility by comparison with the typically developing infants The study thus supports suggestions that very early vocal patterns may prove to be a useful component of early screening and diagnosis of ASD Keywords canonical babbling volubility vocal patterns early detection ASD and early vocal development Early intervention is critical for positive outcomes for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD Early identification of atypical behaviors that manifest during infancy could significantly impact age of diagnosis and subsequent initiation of intervention Currently the minimum age at which the majority of children with ASD can be reliably diagnosed with relative stability is two years eg Chawarska et al Lord but according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control many children are not Correspondence concerning this article

or kindergarten age Research targeting early detection has primarily focused on behaviors exhibited during toddlerhood months and preschool years months eg Matson Fodstad Dempsey Volkmar Chawarska after diagnosis has been made Use of retrospective video analyses and studies of infant siblings of children diagnosed with ASD has allowed examination of possible indicators of ASD in the first year of life eg Baranek Osterling Dawson Munson Sheinkopf Iverson Rinaldi Lester Zwaigenbaum et al Still the most widely used autism screening tool for young children the Modified Checklist for Autism Toddlers MCHAT Robins Fein Barton Green is recommended for ages months We sought to identify potential communication markers of ASD that might be observed within the first year of life in a retrospective evaluation of data from infants recorded at home and later diagnosed with ASD We focused on presumed precursors to language for two reasons First communication impairment is a core deficit in ASD and second evaluation of very early vocal behaviors in typically developing infants has already established markers that are critical to normal vocal communicative development One robust prespeech vocal milestone is the onset of canonical babbling A canonical syllable eg ba is comprised of a consonantlike sound and a vowellike sound with a rapid transition between them Oller A second potentially important vocal measure that we considered is volubility the rate of infant vocalization independent of vocal type Nathani Lynch Oller Obenchain Menn YoshinagaItano Canonical babbling as a key milestone In typical development infants from birth produce vegetative vocalizations eg coughs burps etc and cry as well as vowellike sounds that become more elaborate with time incorporating supraglottal articulations until canonical syllables emerge usually by early in the second halfyear of life Robust onset of canonical babbling has been well documented in typically developing infants by not later than months Koopmansvan Beinum van der Stelt Oller Stark The impression of robustness has been reinforced by the fact that no delay in onset of canonical babbling has been discerned in infants anticipated to be atrisk for communication deficits due to premature birth or low socioeconomic status Eilers et al Oller Eilers Basinger Steffens Urbano Even infants with Down syndrome usually show normal ages of onset although a group level delay of a month or more is detectable Lynch et al Furthermore infants tracheostomized at birth to provide an artificial airway that prevents or substantially inhibits vocalization for many months tend to produce ageappropriate canonical syllables within a short period after decannulation Bleile Stark McGowan Locke Pearson Ross Simon Fowler Handler Only profound hearing impairment and Williams syndrome have been shown to produce consistent substantial delays in the onset of canonical babbling Kent Osberger Netsell Hustedde Koopmansvan Beinum Clement van den DikkenbergPot Masataka Oller Eilers StoelGammon Otomo Further supporting the idea that restricted hearing prevents experiences critical to onset of canonical babblingPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptage of onset in severely or profoundly hearing impaired infants has been reported to be positively correlated with age of amplification Eilers Oller In infants without known disorders onset of canonical babbling after ten months has been shown to be a significant predictor of language delay or other developmental disabilities Oller Eilers Neal Schwartz Stark Ansel Bond StoelGammon But late onset of canonical babbling is a rare occurrence in infants without easily diagnosed physical or mental limitations The seeming resistance to derailment of this developmental milestone suggests that canonical babbling is of such importance in human development that it has been evolved to emerge within a relatively tightly constrained time period in spite of substantial variations in home environments and perinatal events The importance of canonical babbling in predicting later language functioning is assumed to be due to the fact that words are overwhelmingly composed of canonical syllables and thus lexical learning depends on control of canonical syllables To date only two studies of which we are aware have targeted canonical babbling in ASD and neither specifically examined the onset of canonical babbling But reasons for optimism that delays in onset of canonical babbling could constitute an early ASD marker can be found in research showing that various aspects of vocalization appear to be disrupted in young children with ASD Paul Augustyn Klin Volkmar Peppe McCann Gibbon OHara Rutherford Sheinkopf Mundy Oller Steffens Warren Gilkerson Richards Oller Wetherby et al Research using automated analysis of allday recordings based on the automated LENA Language ENvironment Analysis system of classification has shown clear indications that young children with ASD months display low rates of canonical syllable production compared with typically developing infants even after matching of subgroups for expressive language Oller et al Even more to the point one recent study has assessed the usage of canonical syllables though not the onset of canonical babbling in infants at highrisk for ASD because they were siblings of children with ASD seven of participants in the study received a provisional diagnosis of ASD at months Paul Fuerst Ramsay Chawarska Klin As a group the atrisk infants all produced significantly lower mean canonical babbling ratios canonical syllables divided by all speechlike vocalizations ie those deemed transcribable by the researchers compared to lowrisk infants at ninemonths of age but there were no significant differences at months Nonspeech vocalizations those deemed not transcribable eg yells squeals growls were not included in the evaluation of canonical babbling Other vocal measuresespecially number of consonant like elements and number of speechlike and proportion of nonspeechlike vocalizations also appeared to be potentially useful indicators of emergent ASD Volubility in ASD Volubility or rate of vocalization measured in terms of frequency of syllable or utterance production may be limited in ASD a possibility that is supported by automated analysis of data showing low volubility in ASD from allday recordings on children from to months of age based on the LENA system Warren et al Volubility in infants with severe or profound hearing loss and in infants with Down syndrome has not been found toPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptbe depressed compared with typically developing infants however infants from lower socioeconomic status SES have been shown consistently to produce fewer utterances per minute than their middle or high SES peers Eilers et al Oller et al Research suggests that children in low SES experience less communication from caregivers Hart Risley Snow The lower volubility of these infants may be a product of decreased socialcommunication from adults potentially resulting in lower levels of social motivation in the infants Variability in momenttomoment parental interactivity clearly does affect infant volubility by the middle of the first year of life as indicated by research on parentinfant interaction in the stillface paradigm The work suggests a strong tendency in the particular case of parent stillface for infants to increase vocalization rate Specifically volubility during a baseline period of one to three minutes of facetoface vocal interaction is substantially lower than during a following stillface period of one to three minutes where the parent withholds any facial or vocal reaction while continuing to look directly at the infant This pattern is seen in infants after months but not at months where volubility does not change at the shift from facetoface interaction to stillface Delgado Messinger Yale Goldstein Schwade Bornstein Yale Messinger CoboLewis Oller Eilers The results from the stillface paradigm are interpreted to mean that infants seek to reengage the withdrawn parent during the stillface period having learned by the middle of the first year that their vocalizations can have impact Tronick This effect raises the question of whether infants with emergent ASD similarly increase their volubility to reengage their caregivers after a period of withdrawn caregiver attention or whether they decrease volubility possibly due to diminished motivation to engage socially with others Frequency of vocalizations directed at others has been reported to be significantly lower in infants later diagnosed with ASD compared to typically developing infants at months but not at months Ozonoff Iosif Baguio Cook Hill et al It is also notable that frequency of vocalization based on parent report is predictive of language abilities in toddlers with ASD Weismer Lord Esler Paul et al assessed frequency of vocalization in infants at highrisk and lowrisk for developing ASD and found no difference between groups However the study did not actually test for volubility the way volubility is defined here and in much prior research Frequency of vocalization was tallied in a special way in the Paul et al study by counting all speechlike phonetically transcribable and nonspeechlike not phonetically transcribable vocalizations that occurred within the first speechlike vocalizations of each recorded sample But not all participants produced speechlike utterances and in the ones who did the length of recording required to reach the speechlike utterance criterion was variable Thus rate of vocalizations per unit of time was not examined in this study consequently given the common usage of the term volubility it is not possible to determine whether there was a difference in volubility between the groups In addition participants in this study were at highrisk for ASDsome were later diagnosed with ASD while some were not This mixture may have attenuated group differences It should also be noted that Weismer et al included only child vocalizations directed at others while Paul et al included vocalizations Although ASD has roots in social impairments vocalizations directed at others as well as independent vocal play might well be abnormal in ASDPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author ManuscriptA new study of early vocal development in ASD One reason the development of prespeech vocal behaviors in ASD has not been well documented may be that ASD is not reliably diagnosed until long after canonical syllables are expected to emerge thus making prospective analyses challenging Retrospective interviews with parents whose children have been diagnosed with ASD regarding age at which canonical syllables emerged may be hindered by poor parent recall given that parents are generally asked to remember the nature of child babbling that occurred one or more years prior to the time of the interview also parents awareness of the diagnosis may bias their recall of the onset of canonical babbling The effort by Paul et al cited above represents a key advancement in methodology because they assessed infants known to be at risk in a prospective fashion Our approach seizes an additional opportunity afforded by the fortuitous existence of home video data from the first year of life that can be analyzed after diagnosis of ASD for comparison with similar video data from infants who did not receive the diagnosis As indicated in studies cited above emergence of canonical syllables is a critical milestone in the development of spoken language and delayed onset has been shown to be predictive of significant communication impairment Canonical babbling and volubility have not been well characterized in infants with ASD To arrive at a better understanding of these two variables as potential indicators of ASD risk in infants we investigated vocalizations of infants later diagnosed with ASD and typically developing TD infants at two age ranges months and months using retrospective video analysis methods Previous research has suggested that nearly all TD infants reach the canonical babbling stage by months Eilers Oller and on the assumption that a delay might be present in the children later diagnosed with ASD we predicted such delay would be observed in this age range We took the opportunity also to evaluate the available data at months because any infant with a failure to show canonical babbling at that age would be greatly delayed in canonical babbling onset and would be considered at very high risk for a variety of disorders The coding scheme for this study is based on a widely applied method for laboratorybased evaluation of canonical babbling Oller In accord with this method infants are assumed to be in the canonical stage if they show a canonical babbling ratio canonical syllables divided by all syllables of at least a value based on coding by trained listeners of a recording A value of or greater from such laboratory coding has been empirically determined in prior research as corresponding to parent judgments that infants are in the canonical stage Lewedag It has been reasoned that parent judgments constitute the most appropriate standard for establishing this criterion value Oller This reasoning is based on three points Parents respond to interview questions by providing very consistent and accurate information about canonical babbling in their infants Papouek Oller Eilers Basinger this parental capability is predictable given that recognizing canonical babbling represents nothing more than being able to recognize syllables as being wellformed enough that they could form parts of words in real speech and of course normal adults can easily recognize vocalizations of humans as speech or non speech and parents appear to intuitively understand that the onset of canonical babblingPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptis an emergent foundation for speech as evidenced by the fact that they initiate intuitive lexical teaching as soon as they begin to recognize canonical babbling in their infants Papouek Consistent parent recognition of the onset of canonical babbling runs in parallel with recognition of other developmental milestones eg sitting unsupported crawling walking In our study we could not use parents as informants about the age of onset of canonical babbling since that onset had occurred a very long time before our first contact with them Consequently the canonical babbling ratio determined from recordings coded in our laboratory provided the best available measure upon which to base inference about whether infants had reached the canonical stage In the present study the following hypotheses were tested Infants later diagnosed with ASD will be less likely than TD infants to be in the canonical stage at each age and months as determined by whether their canonical babbling ratios exceed the criterion Infants later diagnosed with ASD will demonstrate significantly lower canonical babbling ratios independent of the canonical stage criterion compared to TD infants Infants later diagnosed with ASD will demonstrate significantly fewer total vocalizations lower volubility at both age ranges compared to TD infants A combined analysis using both volubility and canonical babbling status will significantly predict group membership Method Participants A total of participants were included in the present study individuals later diagnosed with ASD and individuals in the TD group Table There was one set of fraternal twins in the ASD group Participants were drawn from a larger study conducted at the University of North CarolinaChapel Hill based on availability of video recordings participants must have had two fiveminute edited video segments at months and at least one edited video segment at months As part of the larger study participants were recruited from the Midwest and Southeast over a year time period Recruitment criteria included child age between two and seven years at the time of recruitment available home videotapes of the child between birth and two years of age that parents were willing to share and enough video footage for at least one minute codable segment see video editing section below of the child at either or months of age All participants included in the ASD group received a clinical diagnosis of ASD from a licensed psychologist andor physician at a point after the recordings were made Thus our design is a retrospective analysis similar to others that have used home movies of children later diagnosed with ASD Baranek Werner Dawson Osterling Dinno A trained research staff member validated diagnoses for each participant using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV American

Interview Revised ADIR Rutter LeCouteur Lord All participants had CARS scores and each participant in the ASD group had ADIADIR scores and of the ASD participants had ADOS scores Typically developing group membership was based in part on scores within normal limits ie not more than one standard deviation below the mean on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning Mullen andor the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales VABS Sparrow Balla Cicchetti An additional exclusionary criterion for any participants in the TD group was any history of learning or developmental difficulties per parent report Individuals with significant physical visual or hearing impairments or known genetic conditions eg Fragile X or Retts Syndrome associated with ASD were excluded As indicated in Table mean age in months was very similar across groups gender was balanced and the two groups were also similar with regard to SES based on maternal education Our families were mostly middle SES with access to videotaping equipment The University of North CarolinaChapel Hill Institutional Review Board approved the study and all families signed informed consents For more information regarding recruitment and inclusion criteria see Baranek Video Editing Procedures Families provided home videos of their child from birth to two years as available The videotapes included footage from a variety of contexts including family play situations vacations outings special events and familiar routines eg mealtimes with individual variation in situational content of each familys videotapes as would be expected in home videotapes All videotapes were copied transformed to digital formats and originals were returned to participating families Video editing guidelines first focused on the identification of video footage during which the child was consistently visible and for which the parents felt they could accurately identify the childs age The two age ranges were originally selected for another study on early behavior in ASD Baranek At the same time the two age ranges are wellsuited to our current purposes The month age range is the earliest age range in which parents had sufficient videotape footage for it to be useful in our research and represents the time period when a number of communicative behaviors emerge Further this is a time frame during which the vast majority of TD children would be expected to already be in the canonical babbling stage The month range provided followup on the same children with the expectation that monitored behaviors would be more consistent and would allow for confirmation or clarification of data from the earlier age In TD children canonical babbling is usually well consolidated by the month age range Vihman Oller In editing tapes for the larger study the aim was to compile two minute video segments for each child in the age range and two minute segments in the month age range On average each minute segment consisted of scenes Research assistants who were blind to the research questions and not informed of the diagnostic status of thePatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptparticipants edited the videotapes and coded each scene for the following content variables a number of people present b amount of physical restriction on childs freedom to move rated as low medium or high c the amount of social intrusion another person was using to engage the child in interaction rated as low medium or high d and the types of events eg meal time bath time active play special events Baranek The assistants were instructed to quasirandomly select a crosssection of scenes from the available footage in the designated age ranges purposely including scenes from each onemonth age interval for which video footage was available within each age range provided that the child was visible in each selected scene All participants included in the current study had two minute compilations ie minutes total for the month age range but at the month age range there were three TD infants and one infant with ASD for whom only a single minute segment was assembled due to insufficient video footage As a result the mean duration of samples at the month age range was minutes rather than Although vocalization from the infants was common in these scenes the segments were not specifically selected to capture vocal behavior Therefore volubility estimated from the present study may be lower than in prior works where infants have been observed in settings designed to maximize vocal interaction Similarly the video segment selection procedure may yield differences in canonical babbling from prior studies In most studies minutes of vocal interaction have been recorded whereas here we had less than half that amount of data per sample Our procedure can be predicted to produce greater variability in canonical babbling ratios than in studies with longer sampling periods Molemans Molemans et al Additionally the audiovideo quality of these home movies was not as good as would be expected in laboratory studies another factor that could reduce perceived canonical babbling and volubility To ensure that the contexts in which children were recorded were comparable specific content parameters were identified and compared Tables and No differences were found between the groups on any content parameter including number of people present level of physical restriction ie amount of physical confinement such as a highchair versus free play rated as low medium or high amount of social intrusion rated as low medium or high and the total number of event types eg meal time active play The number of times each event type eg bath time playtime was represented in the ASD group versus the TD group for each age was compared using chisquare analyses Results for the omnibus chisquare test failed to reach significance in the month age group p but did reach significance in the months age group p Typically developing children were more likely to be engaged in passive activities at the month age range p TD ASD according to followup

certified speechlanguage pathologists who were notPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptinformed of the diagnostic group of the infants The intent was of course for the coders to be blind to diagnostic category and with the exception of one infant to be discussed below the coders reported they saw no reason to suspect any infant of having ASD We defined speechlike vocalizations as in the primary literature on canonical babbling to include both canonical and precanonical infant vocalizations regardless of whether they would be deemed transcribable Training of the two coders was provided by the last author who originated the definition of canonical syllable used in this study and who has conducted and collaborated on numerous studies on onset of canonical babbling rate of canonical babbling and volubility in infants CoboLewis Oller Lynch Levine Lynch et al Oller Eilers Oller Eilers Basinger Oller et al Oller Eilers Neal CoboLewis The two observers were trained in identifying canonical syllables and in counting all syllables independent of their canonical status The video samples used during training were separate although drawn from similar materials based on the home recordings and not included in the analyses for this investigation Syllables were defined as rhythmic units of speechlike vocalization excluding raspberries effort grunt sounds ie a schwalike sounds produced as an artifact of physical exertion ingressive sounds sneezes hiccups crying and laughing Within an utterance which was defined as a vocal breath group Lynch Oller Steffens Buder it was possible to identify syllables as corresponding to sonority peaks high points of pitch andor amplitude that are intuitively recognized by mature listeners These rhythmic events occur in time frames typical of syllables in real speech usually with durations of ms A canonical syllable is defined as including a vowellike nucleus at least one margin or consonantlike sound and a transition between margin and nucleus that is rapid and uninterrupted In general transitions that are too fast to be tracked auditorily too fast to be heard as transitions are instead heard as gestalt syllables Auditory tracking of these transitions focuses on formant acoustic energy transitions that can be measured on spectrograms as typically ms Oller Formants are audible bands of energy corresponding to resonant frequencies of the vocal tract that change as the tract changes shape or size Audible formant transitions occur then when the vocal tract moves during opening from a consonantal closure into a vowel or vice versa Examples of canonical utterances which must include at least one canonical syllable are syllables that a listener might perceive as ba taka or gaga Vocalizations produced while mouthing objects eg toys or fingers or eating were excluded from our analyses on the grounds that we could not be sure what role movement of the hands may have played in the apparent syllabification Videos were randomized and randomly distributed across the two coders with regard to diagnostic group The participants videos were randomly split between the coders by participant and included both age ranges The coders independently watched the videos counting both syllables and canonical syllables in real time This procedure is utilized regularly in the laboratories of the last author in accord with reasoning presented in recentPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptpapers especially Ramsdell et al This naturalistic listening approach mimics how a mother would hear her child listening to each utterance only once The measure of canonical babbling ratio used here number of canonical syllables divided by number of all syllables is the measure utilized in the bulk of research on onset of canonical babbling to date However some studies have used a different ratio number of canonical syllables divided by number of utterances The former procedure is generally preferred nowadays because the resulting value can be interpreted as a proportion with values varying from to whereas the latter procedure yields a ratio with no effective upper limit Oller In a coder agreement test both observers independently coded twenty samples consisting of two fiveminute segments of ten participants video footage A research assistant unaware of the study goals selected these test samples and they represented both diagnostic groups and both ages Reliability was gauged in accord with the degree to which coders agreed upon canonical syllables total syllables and whether the child was in the canonical babbling stage ie had a canonical babbling ratio the standard criterion Interrater agreement ranged from good to excellent for canonical syllables ICC CI and for total syllables ICC CI Reliability for canonical babbling ratios was also good ICC CI with agreement on the canonical stage criterion at for the twenty samples Additionally the coders differed by an average of only of the total range of canonical babbling ratios obtained and the correlation across the ratios for the twenty samples for the two coders was For volubility the coders differed by an average of of the total range for volubility values and the correlation across the twenty sample videos for the two coders was Results Analyses were performed to confirm that the groups were matched on demographic variables These analyses did not reveal significant differences between groups on any variable see Table Initial descriptive statistics for within and betweengroup variables revealed two outliers in the ASD group Both cases produced very high canonical babbling ratios in the month range and relative to the mean for both groups ASD for the cases TD see Figure Based on prior research the canonical babbling ratios observed for these two ASD cases were substantially higher than would be expected in TD infants in the month age rangeinfants grouped as having English or Spanish at home as high or low SES and as born at term or prematurely all showed mean canonical babbling ratios under from to months of age Oller Eilers Urbano CoboLewis Oller Eilers Steffens Lynch Urbano Analysis of zscores revealed that infant was standard deviations above the mean for the present sample and infant was standard deviations above the mean further suggesting outlier status On this basis we decided to eliminate these two cases in the primary analyses on canonical babbling the remaining cases ASD TD were analyzed to address our research questions regarding canonical babbling see Figures and for canonical babbling ratios by participant at both ages withPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptthe two outliers indicated However there were no significant outliers with regard to volubility and thus we included data from all cases for that analysis see Figures and for syllable volubility by participant at both ages Hypothesis Infants later diagnosed with ASD will be less likely than typically developing infants to be in the canonical stage at each age and months Log odds ratios log OR were calculated to compare the classifications of both ASD and typically developing children with regard to their canonical babbling The criterion for canonical babbling stage was set at or greater canonical syllables compared to all syllables this is a common criterion in studies of canonical babbling and is based on data reviewed in Oller TD infants were significantly more likely to have reached the canonical babbling stage based on the criterion than were infants later diagnosed with ASD at the months age range N log OR CI to p and remained more likely at the month age range N log OR CI to p As an easily interpretable effect size measure the simple odds ratios as opposed to the log odds ratio which is statistically preferable for significance testing with small Ns can be considered the simple ORs indicated TD infants were times more likely OR to be categorized as in the canonical stage than ASD infants at months and times more likely OR at months Hypothesis Infants later diagnosed with ASD will demonstrate significantly lower canonical babbling ratios independent of the canonical stage criterion compared to typically developing infants Canonical babbling ratios of infants later diagnosed with ASD and TD infants were contrasted using a Mixed ANOVA The betweensubjects variable was diagnostic category ASD vs TD and the withinsubjects variable was age range months and months The mean canonical babbling ratios at months were SD for the infants later diagnosed with ASD and SD for the TD infants at months the values were SD and SD respectively Figure Analyses revealed a significant main effect for diagnostic category F p p with infants later diagnosed with ASD producing significantly lower canonical babbling ratios and a significant main effect for age F p p with higher canonical babbling ratios at the older age The effect size between groups for months was d a large effect and for months was a moderate effect Cohen The age by diagnosis interaction was not significant p Hypothesis Infants later diagnosed with ASD will demonstrate significantly fewer total vocalizations lower volubility at both age ranges compared to typically developing infants For this analysis all infants were included because there were no significant outliers Volubility of infants later diagnosed with ASD and TD infants were contrasted

SD syllables per minute while TDPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptinfants produced a mean of SD syllables per minute at months At months infants later diagnosed with ASD produced a mean of SD syllables per minute while TD infants produced a mean of SD syllables per minute see Figure Analyses revealed a significant main effect for diagnostic category F p p and for age F p p Thus infants later diagnosed with ASD displayed significantly lower volubility than TD infants The effect size for group at months was d large and at months was large Hypothesis A combined analysis using both volubility and canonical babbling status will significantly predict group membership Logistic regression analysis was conducted to test whether canonical babbling status whether each participant met the criterion and volubility at age ranges of months and months could reliably predict later diagnosis status group membership This test was conducted with all cases included partly in order to match the number of cases for the two predictor variables and partly because the goal of the analysis was to determine the potential practical utility of identification of these children without any information other than volubility and canonical babbling ratio This test may thus be the one of primary clinical interest since it evaluates the circumstance that screening implies where there would be no basis for knowing whether an infant might be an outlier on any variable Without this evaluation there would be no direct indication in our results of the degree of group discriminability Statistical significance was reached in a test of the full model against a constantonly model which indicated that as a set canonical babbling status and volubility reliably predicted later diagnosis p df A smalltomoderate relationship between prediction and grouping was observed Nagelkerkes R with an overall prediction success of for TD and for ASD However further examination of the predictors using the Wald criterion revealed that when all four predictor variables were included in the model none significantly contributed to prediction of group membership at an individual level p The status of infants with regard to canonical babbling stage at the months age range provided the largest observed predictive contribution Wald p EXPB The contribution to group discriminability by volubility at and months age ranges approached nil EXPB and respectively Examination of the correlations among the predictor variables showed that all but volubility at months were significantly correlated with all other predictors Table with volubility at months significantly correlated with only canonical babbling at months This interrelation among the predictor variables suggests that to some degree they account for some of the same variance in diagnosis However the observed EXPB values odds ratios of the outcomes given the value of an individual predictor more strongly suggest that canonical babbling at months accounted for the bulk of the variability in diagnosis It seems clear that significance of the individual predictors in the logistic regression may have been hampered by the high level of relation among them Individually the volubilityPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptvariables did not appear to have much influence given small Betas and high pvalues When predictors were entered into the model in a hierarchical fashion no matter how predictor entry was ordered month variables at step and month variables at step or CB variables at step and volubility at step only the month CB variable was a significant independent predictor R changes and diagnostic ability for all of the regression and regression step iterations suggested little was added to the R by adding variables in the second step even with two more predictor variables only was added to R nor did these additions substantially alter the ability of the model to predict later diagnosis The most efficient model appeared to be a logistic regression with month CB as the only predictor Discussion The importance of early intervention for children with ASD has resulted in attempts to quantify behaviors in infancy that may lead to early detection Substantial effort has addressed gestural and social development and their potential roles in detection within the first year of life eg Watson Crais Baranek Dykstra Wilson The present results offer parallel findings in the domain of vocal development by demonstrating significant group differences in canonical babbling status canonical babbling ratio and total syllables produced volubility during the first year of life In our study infants later diagnosed with ASD were significantly less likely to be classified as being in the canonical babbling stage and demonstrated significantly reduced canonical babbling ratios compared to TD peers Although significant group differences were apparent in both age ranges and months the effect sizes for canonical babbling were larger at months Paul et al demonstrated similar results in infants at highrisk for developing ASD who produced significantly lower canonical babbling ratios compared to low risk infants at months though at months the differences were not statistically significant Combined with the finding from Oller et al that children with ASD up to months of age show low canonical syllable production the data here suggest that low production of canonical syllables may be a helpful marker for ASD from infancy into early childhood Since canonical babbling is well established in the vast majority of TD infants by months Eilers and Oller it might seem odd that several of the TD infants at months and at months in the present study provided samples that did not meet the canonical babbling ratio criterion for assignment to the canonical stage of vocal development However it is important to consider the fact that even infants who are clearly in the canonical stage based on parent report often fail to reach the criterion in a single laboratory sample of minutes Lewedag In addition unlike the samples in prior research on canonical babbling the samples here were not designed to elicit vocalizations and consequently they may have been less rich in quantity and variety of vocalization than the samples that were used to develop the criterion Further our samples at months were only minutes in duration and at months an average of slightly less than minutes it has been shown that variability in obtained canonical babbling ratios increases as the length of samples decreases Molemans Molemans Van den BergPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author ManuscriptVan Severen Gillis Finally our samples were based on home recordings with considerable noise and variable camera management that may have impeded our ability to recognize vocalizations in the samples Consequently we are not surprised that some of the TD infants failed to reach the criterion used to determine canonical status based on laboratory samples Given the strong links between the onset of canonical babbling and language development Oller Eilers Urbano CoboLewis StoelGammon delayed onset of canonical babbling in infants with ASD may reflect latent communication impairment It also may be that delayed canonical babbling directly contributes to communication symptoms in ASD Canonical babbling requires motor ability as well as motivation to produce syllables and practice in babbling may lay critical foundations for speech Prospective research on motor development in infants later diagnosed with ASD is sparse and often limited to highrisk groups but available research does indicate that early motor impairment may be present eg Matson Mahan Fodstad Hess Neal Manjiviona Prior Page Boucher Teitelbaum Teitelbaurm Nye Fryman Maurer Thus delayed canonical babbling may reflect an immature or disordered motor system with specific implications for speech If language develops as a consequence of social reinforcement of speechlike sounds that eventually evolve into true words consider behavioral models of language development as in Hulit Howard Goldstein King West Goldstein Schwade Goldstein West then social reinforcement may encourage the production of canonical babbling Children with ASD may be less motivated by social reinforcement yielding less frequent vocal exploration and production of canonical syllables than in TD infants To add to the problem a delay in canonical babbling may result in reduction in caregiver socialcommunication directed toward the infant On average by six to seven months and very rarely later than ten months canonical babbling emerges in TD infants Eilers Oller In response to recognition of canonical babbling caregivers alter their communication pattern sometimes attempting to direct the infant toward using canonical syllables meaningfullyfor example the parent who hears baba may reply Yes thats a bubble Papouek StoelGammon Therefore infants who are delayed in canonical babbling may also be delayed in their exposure to important linguistic input and thus may be given less opportunity to learn words A final point is that infants with ASD may simply have lower motivation to vocalize socially in the first place This lower motivation could provide a further basis for slow vocabulary learning Our results on volubility included two statistically reliable findings First children in both groups had lower volubility at the second age than at the first We attribute no particular theoretical importance to this finding but we take note of the fact that the lower level of volubility at months compared to months did correspond to greater physical movement of the children at the older age In both groups combined level of physical restriction during the selected recording samples was significantly less at the older age p As reported earlier level of physical restriction was not significantly different between diagnostic groupsPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author ManuscriptThe second volubility finding is that infants later diagnosed with ASD produced significantly fewer vocalizations deemed to be relevant for the emergence of speech both canonical and noncanonical sounds at both age ranges and months compared to TD peers Other research has demonstrated that infants with ASD direct fewer vocalizations to others Ozonoff et al our study extends this finding to a more general measure of volubility in terms of total vocalizations syllables rather than only ones directed to others Our finding is also congruent with results from automated analysis of all day recordings indicating low volubility in children with ASD at months of age Warren et al The results may seem to run counter to Paul et al whose sample of highrisk infants were reported to not produce significantly fewer vocalizations than lowrisk infants However as described in the introduction above the Paul et al study did not report data in a way that can be directly compared with the volubility data reported here Some disability groups eg hearing impaired infants and infants with cleft palate have been reported to exhibit volubility similar to that of TD infants Clement Chapman HardinJones Schulte Halter Van den DikkenbergPot Koopmansvan Beinum Clement Nathani Oller Neal Davis Morrison von Hapsburg Warner Czyz however infants from low SES households have been reported to have significantly decreased volubility in comparison to those from higher SES households Oller Eilers Basinger Steffens Urbano Children from low SES backgrounds are often presumed to be atrisk for language deficits Although it would be impossible to identify and quantify all of the mechanisms through which poverty may affect language development research has demonstrated that the amount of communication caregivers direct toward their children is decreased in low SES situations Hart Risley This impoverished linguistic environment may result in decreased dyadic social and communicative interactions and thus in a decrease in overall volubility of infants It is important to note that the relatively wellmatched SES between our two groups suggests that the differences in volubility were not attributable to differences in SES In the case of low SES households an impoverished linguistic environment due to lack of parent responsiveness might be expected to lead to decreased volubility of the infant and later language difficulty For infants later diagnosed with ASD reduced volubility may be affected by multiple factors not related to inherent parental responsiveness but related instead to the social impairments of ASD One issue is that these children may experience less linguistic stimulation due to having disrupted sensory processing systems corresponding to sensory hyporesponsiveness children with ASD are less likely to respond or require substantially more stimulation to respond to environmental events Baranek Baranek et al Miller Reisman McIntosh Simon Rogers Ozonoff This characteristic of ASD is also reflected in the tendency for infants as young as eight months who will later be diagnosed with ASD to be less likely than TD infants to respond to their name being called Werner Dawson Osterling Dinno This lack of responsiveness may indicate that infants with ASD are less affected by vocal communication from caregivers than TD infants If so the lack of responsiveness may reflect an effectively impoverished linguistic environment because of attenuated reception of caregiver input by infants with ASD and subsequent communication impairments IndeedPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptsensory hyporesponsiveness has been shown to be associated with poorer language functioning in children with ASD Watson et al An additional way that the environment for children with ASD may be impoverished could involve a social feedback loop Warlaumont et al that is under investigation using automated analysis of vocalizations of parents and infants from allday home recordings Since infants with ASD produce fewer canonical syllables than TD infants and since parents respond strongly with language stimulation to canonical syllables an infant with ASD may actually hear less language from parents because parents provide input that is tied to the infants output The infants low volubility may then be aggravated by lower input levels resulting from the infants own anomalous pattern of vocalization Finally the logistic regression analysis with four independent variables age and age canonical babbling classification and age and age volubility demonstrated that classification of diagnostic category ASD vs TD could be predicted with accuracy even when the two outliers were included The model more accurately classified infants later diagnosed with ASD Sensitivity than TD infants Specificity The strongest predictor of group membership was canonical babbling classification at months as it alone correctly classified of infants later diagnosed with ASD and of TD infants Thus in the search for markers of ASD risk in infancy canonical babbling status at months appears to be the single best candidate among the variables considered in the current study The utility of the measure as a group marker is age dependent since a larger proportion of infants in the ASD group at months had reached the canonical stage than at months To help better understand the high canonical babbling ratios of the two outliers the coders both certified speechlanguage pathologists viewed the videos from those infants again after their outlier status was identified We speculated that the outlier status of these two infants may be related to the phenomenon of motor stereotypy that is common in ASD that is that the two infants were engaged at least in the month samples in a motor stereotypy focused precisely on canonical babbling In reexamining the videos of the two outliers the coders looked for qualitative evidence that might speak to the credibility of this speculation In the second viewing of the recordings the coders noticed that the first outlier infant produced the majority of the canonical syllables during a single scene while walking outside He repeatedly produced a da syllable during this brief episode but did not direct his vocalizations to the caregiver The sense that a prelinguistic vocal stereotypy may have been operating was enhanced by the fact that the same syllable was repeated throughout The stereotypy of canonical babbling in this infant was reported by the coders as constituting the only evidence either had noticed as specifically suggesting the possibility of ASD while they were coding and thus this was the single case where the intended blinding of the coders to diagnostic group seems to have been foiled The coders did not observe any other stereotypic behaviors vocal or otherwise in these samples The second infant engaged in high canonical babble production while roughhousing with his father but to our clinical eyes that behavior did not seem particularly unusual Further research on the possibility that babbling can be a focus of motor stereotypy in ASD seems in order It may be worthy ofPatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptnote that the two outliers CARS scores and fell within the range of the scores for the ASD group In addition to the findings suggesting possible clinically useful markers for ASD the present results provide a new scientific view on the robustness of canonical babbling There has been no prior empirical indication that canonical babbling onset is delayed in ASD nor that volubility is low in infants later diagnosed with ASD Our results thus suggest that the development of vocalization in infancy is affected by whatever the fundamental disorders of ASD may be Assuming ASD to be a social disorder it is not obvious that babbling would necessarily be disturbed in the disorder because the extent to which babbling is a social as opposed to an endogenously generated phenomenon is itself an empirical question Our results can then be thought to provide a new empirical perspective on the possible social nature of babbling The results also suggest that the vocal differentiation of the two groups is robust given the relative clarity of the results indicating low canonical babbling and volubility in the infants in the ASD group even though we had samples of low recording quality and very limited duration The results seem especially significant in the context of a broad body of research cited above on the robustness of canonical babbling as a foundation for language and on the robust resistance of canonical babbling to delay as seen in prior studies cited in our paperno delay has been found in cases of prematurity low SES or multilingual exposure Future Directions and Limitations This study provides a proof of concept regarding the notion of atypical emergence of the canonical babbling stage in the developing infant who will later be diagnosed with ASD and the possibility that tracking canonical babbling in infancy may add to our repertoire of markers for ASD prior to one year of age Future research to address some of the limitations of the current study and advance our understanding of the development of canonical babbling among infants with ASD is warranted by the findings of the current study One limitation in the current study was the lack of a comparison group of infants with later diagnoses of nonASD disabilities which prevents us from definitively attributing the differences found in this study to ASD rather than general impairments in cognition or communication Our working hypothesis to test in future studies will be that these differences in canonical babbling onset and in volubility are specific to ASD Another limitation was that our study used only short video segments from each time point which surely impacted our ability to precisely assess important aspects of vocalization because it has been shown that variability in obtained canonical babbling ratios increases as the length of samples decreases Molemans Molemans Van den Berg Van Severen Gillis The low canonical babbling ratios obtained for a few of the TD infants presumably would not have occurred with larger sample sizes In future studies we hope to obtain longer samples and if possible to more precisely identify canonical babbling onset through longitudinal laboratory assessments paired with caregiver report of onset But of course to make this possible prospective studies may be necessary with several years of followup presumably taking advantage of the opportunity presented by sibling studies Such studies would also afford the opportunity to obtain much better recordings than arePatten et al Page J Autism Dev Disord Author manuscript available in PMC October NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscript NIHPA Author Manuscriptavailable in retrospective studies such as the present one Indeed sibling studies can now capitalize on allday recording yielding the opportunity to assess vocal development in ASD with much greater ecological validity and representativeness Onset of canonical babbling usually occurs between and months in TD infants It appears from the present data that onset may occur within a much wider range in ASD Quantification of onset in ASD may yield prognostic value regarding core communication symptoms For example if canonical stage onset is delayed beyond a certain threshold the infant may be at especially highrisk for remaining nonverbal Discovery of such a delay could allow specific interventions to be tailored based on prognosis earlier in development Future research should also focus on caregivers and their roles in canonical stage development and its identification Prior work suggests that with TD infants parents are extremely accurate in their reports of the onset of canonical babbling Oller et al If caregivers of infants with ASD are similarly capable of identifying onset of canonical babbling it may be possible to use canonical babbling onset as part of a parentreport screening tool for early identification In addition alterations in communication directed to infants by caregivers as canonical babbling emerges may help to elicit and maintain social communicative interaction and subsequently impact language development Our findings on volubility represent another potential avenue for understanding early social communication development processes in ASD Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this possibility is suggested by the proposal that there may be a feedback loop involving low canonical syllable production in ASD followed by low parental rate of vocalization to infants aggravating the low volubility and low rate of canonical syllables in ASD Warlaumont et al We anticipate rapid growth of studies tracking this possibility especially since there is a rapidly growing possibility of conducting some aspects of such analysis based on automated classification of vocalizations in allday recordings as indicated by the growth of LENA system studies Clinical Implications Our findings suggest that canonical babbling should be considered an important milestone in infancy that may be delayed in infants who are later diagnosed with ASD If infants demonstrate delays in canonical babbling a developmental assessment that includes evaluation of early warning signs for ASD should be administered Although volubility appears less promising as a marker for ASD it may be useful in combination with other items in the context of early identification screening tools For infants demonstrating either low canonical babbling ratios or low volubility interventions to draw infants attention to socialcommunicative stimuli in that context of dyadic interactions may help stimulate growth of vocal communication
