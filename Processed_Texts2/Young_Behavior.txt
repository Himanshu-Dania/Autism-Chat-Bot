Abstract Background Signs of autism are present in the first two years of life but the average age of diagnosis lags far behind Instruments that improve detection of autism risk in infancy are needed This study developed and tested the psychometric properties of a novel videobased approach to detecting ASD in infancy Methods A prospective longitudinal study of children at elevated or lower risk for autism spectrum disorder was conducted Participants were infants with an older sibling with ASD and infants with no known family history of autism The Videoreferenced Infant Rating System for Autism VIRSA is a webbased application that presents pairs of videos of parents and infants playing together and requires forcedchoice judgments of which video is most similar to the child being rated Parents rated participants on the VIRSA at and months of age We examined splithalf and testretest reliability convergent and discriminant validity and sensitivity specificity and negative and positive predictive value for concurrent and month ASD diagnoses Results The VIRSA demonstrated satisfactory reliability and convergent and discriminant validity VIRSA ratings were significantly lower for children ultimately diagnosed with ASD than children with typical development by months of age VIRSA scores at months identified all children diagnosed with ASD at that age as well as of children diagnosed at months Conclusions This study represents an initial step in the development of a novel videobased approach to detection of ASD in infancy The VIRSAs psychometric properties were promising when used by parents with an older affected child but still must be tested in community samples with no family history of ASD If results are replicated then the VIRSAs lowburden webbased format has the potential to reduce disparities in communities with limited access to screening Keywords Autism Screening Infancy Social Development Correspondence Sally Ozonoff MIND Institute UC Davis Health th

years of life Differences between children who will later receive an ASD diagnosis and those with typical development emerge before the second birthday Gammer et al Landa GarrettMayer Ozonoff et al Zwaigenbaum et al with some studies documenting signs in the first year of life Maestro et al Miller et al Werner Dawson Osterling Dinno and parents first expressing concerns at an average age of months Chawarska et al Despite advances in knowledge about the earliest presentations of ASD the mean age of diagnosis has stubbornly remained over years Baio et al and has not declined over the last two decades squandering years of potential intervention when the brain is most plastic It is critical that further attempts are made to decrease the age of ASD diagnosis so that it better aligns with the age of first symptom emergence One of the identified barriers to more prompt recognition of ASD is measurement Al Qabandi Gorter Rosenbaum Over the last decade much effort has gone into the development of instruments for earlier detection of ASD Zwaigenbaum et al The most feasible method for largescale screening is parent report and most existing measures use this methodology However recent studies have demonstrated low agreement between parent report and more objective measures of ASD symptoms Ozonoff et al as well as lower reliability for screening instruments when used in rural low income less educated and racially diverse samples Khowaja Hazzard Robins Scarpa et al A population screening study of twelvemontholds Pierce et al using a parent report measure Wetherby BrosnanMaddox Peace Newton identified infants with ASD This represents significant underidentification even after accounting for cases with later onset Barger Campbell McDonough since current prevalence studies estimate that of children have ASD Baio et al The lower sensitivity of early screening measures may be due to the subtlety of initial ASD symptoms and the difficulty of accurately conveying them to parents through written descriptions Major sources of error in parent questionnaires include comprehension and interpretation problems Koriat Goldsmith Pansky Krosnick Presser such as limited understanding of the queried constructs inadequate knowledge of developmental milestones and bias due to postevent information eg eventual diagnosis The current study moves beyond verbal descriptions by employing video examples to reduce subjective interpretations The use of videos has been shown to dramatically increase clarity in other fields from music instruction to motor vehicle repair Arguel Jamet Recently video was incorporated in ASD screening by Marrus and colleagues who had parents complete ratings after watching a video of a socially competent toddler in order to reduce discrepant interpretations of items by providing informants with a common naturalistic standard for comparison p Here we describe the development of a new instrument the Videoreferenced Infant Rating System for Autism VIRSA It extends previous approaches Marrus et al by Young et al Page J Child Psychol Psychiatry Author manuscript available in PMC January Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcreating a large library of video clips depicting a wide range of socialcommunication ability and relying solely on video in the ratings with no written descriptions of behavior We hypothesized that the semantic clarity afforded by video would improve early discrimination of infants at highest risk for ASD Methods Instrument Development The VIRSA was developed using video from participants in a longitudinal infant sibling study and then validated on an independent sample of infants Videos used in the VIRSA were drawn from an archive of over minutes of digitized video recorded in a clinical laboratory setting Video depicted infants and parents playing together with ageappropriate toys Segments were selected from a task that used a standardized toy set and instructed parents to play with their child as they would at home Schwichtenberg Kellerman Miller Young Ozonoff Video recordings utilized a consistent camera angle facing the child with the parent in profile All families gave both informed consent and legal authorization to include their videos in the VIRSA Social behaviors including smiles vocalizations and eye contact were coded by research assistants unaware of participant risk group or outcome using a previously validated coding scheme that is sensitive to the changes that occur during the onset of ASD symptoms as early as months Gangi et al Ozonoff et al In order to include a broad range of behaviors in the VIRSA candidate videos were ranked by frequencies of the coded behaviors Twentysecond segments were then excised from the original video files resulting in a collection of over video segments from past participants between and months of age Next video segments were rated by clinical research staff on a scale from least socially competent to most socially competent Each clinician rated a randomly selected set of videos twice to establish testretest reliability mean range Interrater reliability was examined on a larger randomly selected set of video clips rated by all raters using a twoway random ICC model The average measures ICC for absolute agreement was with a lower bound of suggesting strong inter rater reliability of the point scale Video segments were excluded for poor lighting or audio quality obscured video angles or use of the childs name This resulted in a pool of video comprising individual second clips which was then constrained to insure adequate representation across the point rating scale within each age and months To limit the software overhead for the VIRSA app videos were then randomly selected to create the final VIRSA video library The final pool of video included segments from children with ASD children with nonASD developmental concerns eg speechlanguage delays and children with typical development based on month outcome children total Thirtyeight of the children depicted in VIRSA videos were male and were NonHispanic Caucasian Analysis of ratings of VIRSA videos using a generalized linear model with random effects for subjects and age revealed a significant group effect X df p with the ASD videos rated an average of CI to the videos of children with nonASD developmental concerns rated an average of CI to and the videos of typically developing Young et al Page J Child Psychol Psychiatry Author manuscript available in PMC January Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptparticipants rated an average of CI to Simple comparisons indicated that the ratings of the ASD videos differed significantly from the videos of both the non ASD developmental concerns t p and typically developing cases t p who did not differ from one another t p as expected Since the VIRSA was designed specifically to detect the socialcommunication behaviors relevant to ASD but not broader developmental delays this pattern of results provided further validation of the final video pool The library of video segments was incorporated into a webbased application that presented pairs of videos depicting differing degrees of social competence side by side accompanied by the prompt Which video is more like your childs interaction with you on a typical day On each trial the video on the left played automatically followed by the video on the right at which point the viewer selected the one most like the child Presentation of video followed an algorithm that always began with a pair of videos rated as less social and more social on the point scale After each choice the algorithm selected and displayed a second pair of videos with new scale values contingent upon the previously chosen videos ranking In each subsequent trial the viewers video choice dictated the range of sociability represented in the videos on the next trial analogous to how optometrists help patients select eyeglass prescriptions In this way the algorithm presented videos of increasing similarity over subsequent trials until the distance between videos reduced to rating scale point on subsequent trials at which point the average rating of the last trials was recorded as the final score see Figure S in online Appendix for examples The VIRSA web application was designed with a brief introductory video that oriented parents to the concepts and range of social behaviors depicted in the videos and provided rating instructions The VIRSA app also asked for confirmation of the childs age in order to present videos from a matching age group Since multiple video exemplars of each scale point to were available videos were sampled from the pool without replacement The UC Davis Institutional Review Board approved the study procedures Parents signed an informed consent form prior to participation They completed VIRSA ratings when their child was and monthsold and again two weeks later to examine testretest reliability An automated email invited parents to the online VIRSA app which could be accessed by computer or mobile device eg smartphones tablets VIRSA ratings were always done prior to inperson assessments which were conducted at and months by examiners unaware of risk group or previous test results Participants The VIRSA validation sample consisted of infants with an older sibling with ASD with no known family history of autism none of whom supplied videos used in instrument development Twentyone children in the familial highrisk HR group received a diagnosis of ASD whereas none of the lowrisk LR children did ASD diagnoses were made at any age that a child met DSM criteria based on all information available One child was diagnosed with ASD at months were diagnosed at months at months and at months All children diagnosed before months retained the ASD diagnosis at the final visit The rest of the sample was classified as NonASD and then Young et al Page J Child Psychol Psychiatry Author manuscript available in PMC January Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptstratified by familial risk to yield the HR NonASD and LR NonASD comparison groups Descriptive statistics are shown in Table Measures Mullen Scales of Early Learning MSEL Mullen is an assessment of cognitive motor and language development for children aged to months MSEL scores were used to describe the sample Scores on the Fine Motor and Visual Reception subtests were used to evaluate discriminant validity since these developmental domains are theoretically unrelated to the socialcommunicative focus of the VIRSA Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule nd edition ADOS Lord et al is an observational measure that assesses ASD symptoms through semistandardized interactions between the clinician and child It is comprised of five modules appropriate for various ages and language levels the Toddler module was administered at and months and either module or was used at months depending upon the childs verbal level Analyses utilized the overall total algorithm Social Affect Restricted Repetitive Behavior or SARRB score Scores on the ADOS at months were also used to examine convergent validity with VIRSA ratings at months Analysis Plan Psychometric properties of the VIRSA were examined in several ways Splithalf reliability was analyzed by comparing the first half of the ratings within a given session to the second half Testretest reliability was analyzed by comparing initial VIRSA ratings to those obtained two weeks later Parents were shown the same series of paired videos they had seen two weeks earlier instead of video pairs dictated by the VIRSA algorithm permitting examination of the reliability of individual trial choices Convergent validity was examined through correlations at months with concurrent SARRB algorithm scores on the ADOS Toddler module Discriminant validity was examined by correlating VIRSA scores with concurrent MSEL fine motor and visual reception age equivalents Predictive validity was assessed by examining diagnostic outcome group differences on the VIRSA scores at each age using a mixed model with group age and their interaction included as fixed effects and VIRSA score as the timevarying dependent variable We also used ROC analysis to assess the VIRSAs sensitivity specificity positive predictive value PPV and negative predictive value NPV in predicting ASD diagnosis Area under the curve AUC was computed as a measure of the ability to distinguish between groups Sample sizes initially projected were highrisk and lowrisk infants With an anticipated ASD outcome rate of approximately in the highrisk group power was estimated to be to detect an AUC value of on the ROC analyses All analyses were conducted in R version Results VIRSA trials selections between paired videos took an average of seconds range to SD The average number of trials before a final score was reached was range to SD with completion of the VIRSA taking an average of minutes range to SD Splithalf reliability was moderate at r Young et al Page J Child Psychol Psychiatry Author manuscript available in PMC January Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptand testretest reliability relatively strong with of the same video choices made two weeks later which was significantly greater than chance t df p Convergent validity correlation with concurrent ADOS SARRB algorithm scores at months was r which was significantly stronger than discriminant validity correlations with concurrent MSEL fine motor r Fishers z p and visual reception r Fishers z p age equivalent scores Figure shows the modeled parent VIRSA scores for each group between and months Examination of the model revealed a main effect for group df p The main effect for age and the interaction between age and group were not significant Planned contrasts revealed no significant differences in VIRSA scores between the ASD and comparison groups at months HR NonASD t p LR NonASD t p and months HR NonASD t p LR NonASD t p At months VIRSA scores were significantly lower in the ASD group than both the HR Non ASD t p and the LR NonASD groups t p At months VIRSA scores were significantly lower in the ASD group than in the HR NonASD group t p and marginally lower than the LR NonASD group t p ROC analyses were conducted on VIRSA scores at each age predicting a binary month outcome see Table The thresholdcutoff at which ROC analyses best separated ASD and NonASD cases was defined as the VIRSA score closest to the theoretical limit of maximum specificity and sensitivity The VIRSA performed best at months Table presents ROC models that examined how well VIRSA scores at months predicted concurrent month diagnoses n diagnosed with ASD at that age Sensitivity was no false negatives but specificity and positive predictive value were low Discussion We hypothesized that employing video examples within a screening tool would enable detection of ASD in infancy Starting at months of age VIRSA ratings were significantly lower for the group eventually diagnosed with ASD than for the comparison groups Sensitivity of month VIRSA scores in predicting month diagnosis was approximately This compares quite favorably to a study reporting sensitivity of month clinical diagnostic assessment in predicting month diagnosis of only Ozonoff et al In fact VIRSA scores had better sensitivity even at months of age than that reported for clinical diagnosis at months in Ozonoff et al We hypothesize that the use of video allowed parents to see differences in their child that preceded the full onset of symptoms The VIRSAs sensitivity is especially impressive given the extended time course of development of ASD symptoms Multiple previous studies have demonstrated that symptoms slowly unfold over the first two years of life and many children who are ultimately diagnosed with ASD do not show overt signs before the first birthday Gammer et al Landa GarrettMayer Ozonoff et al Zwaigenbaum et al Children who are not identified by the VIRSA may not yet be showing signs of ASD for parents to rateYoung et al Page J Child Psychol Psychiatry Author manuscript available in PMC January Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptWe also examined the VIRSAs ability to index concurrent symptoms ROC analyses of VIRSA ratings at months identified all eight children who had been diagnosed with ASD by that age with no false negatives A recent metaanalysis of the accuracy of ASD screeners between and months of age SanchezGarcia et al reported a pooled sensitivity of and specificity of The sensitivity of the VIRSA at months is thus comparable to or better than existing measures and suggests that it may be a useful adjunct in identifying toddlers in need of referral for an ASD evaluation Its specificity and positive predictive value however were lower than recommended standards Cicchetti et al resulting in overidentification of risk For this reason the present results do not support use of the VIRSA as a standalone ASD screener in infancy yet Future studies could examine whether using the VIRSA as an initial step in a twostage screening process improves accuracy In addition to the predictive validity of the VIRSA we examined a number of other psychometric properties Testretest reliability was strong with parents selecting over of the same videos when they retook the VIRSA two weeks later VIRSA scores at months were significantly correlated with ADOS scores and correlations were significantly higher than with measures of divergent abilities eg fine motor and visual reception skills The majority of participants and all the children who developed ASD came from the high risk group eg had older siblings with ASD It is imperative prior to recommending the VIRSA for clinical use to examine its psychometric properties when used by parents who are nave to ASD The positive predictive value of an instrument is dependent upon the base rate of the condition in the population Clark Harrington Grimes Schulz and thus the VIRSAs predictive ability may be reduced in a communitybased sample that has a lower prevalence of ASD than in highrisk families Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to determine whether the present results generalize to lowrisk samples Despite these limitations the VIRSA makes several contributions to the literature First it demonstrates that it is possible to develop a parent report instrument capable of identifying ASD risk in the first year of life Second it demonstrates that video can be used to clarify developmental phenomena and improve parent reporting of early development Finally an innovation of the VIRSA is its webbased mobileoptimized application Over of American adults of childbearing age own a smartphone with rates over even in lower income rural and minority communities Pew Research Center It is vital that screening procedures keep pace with such advances in technology and societys increasingly internetbased preferences for information acquisition and communication Thus this study provides an initial step in the proof of principle of video and webbased screening for ASD With further development the VIRSA with its lowburden quick online ratings has potential to reduce disparities in communities with limited access to screening and provide the possibility of initiating intervention before the full symptom set of ASD has emerged Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed
