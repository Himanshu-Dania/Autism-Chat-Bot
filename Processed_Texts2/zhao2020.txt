University No The current issue and full text archive of this journal is available on Emerald Insight at Received August Revised December Accepted January Library Hi Tech Emerald Publishing Limited DOI LHTbasis of communication and interpersonal relationships with others Abnormal expression is a prominent manifestation of autism and it is also one of the criteria for the diagnosis of autism Doctors can diagnose autism by responding to abnormal facial expressions in children Autism also known as autism or autism disorders is a representative disease of generalized developmental disorders In recent years the incidence of autism in children has become higher and higher experiencing a transition from rare diseases to epidemics At present research on autism is still in its infancy at home and abroad and research methods and tools are still developing The main symptoms of autism include impaired social and interpersonal communication language retardation repetitive behavior and sensory dysfunction It is difficult for autistic patients to correctly recognize faces and explain facial emotions They have different emotional expressions from ordinary people and they cannot correctly perceive and understand some basic expressions such as anger Yan At present the diagnostic methods for autism spectrum disorders include traditional standard DSMIVTR Segal and ICD Organization W H various autism diagnostic assessment scales such as Childhood Autism Rating Scale CARS the autism child behavior scale ABC and autism behavior rating scale and questionnaire interviews Wang and Lu Most of these methods rely on doctors direct observation of the patient s expression speech and behavior based on their experience Diagnostic results are easily disturbed by external factors such as hospital level physician s subjective level patient s education level age and so on There are relatively large subjective factors resulting in a certain degree of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis It takes about h for each autistic patient to diagnose so doctors have a lot of work to do The best period of treatment for autistic patients is before the age of six Early diagnosis is of great significance for the rehabilitation of autistic patients The purpose of our research and design is to train the model and make a facial expression recognition system based on the normal expression so as to verify the abnormal expression This system can test the facial expression of autistic children and judge the difference between autistic children and normal children In this study FER and CK were used as the main facial expression training samples At the same time we collected the facial expression image data of Chinese children as a supplementary sample of facial expression With the help of VGG andResnet algorithm models of deep convolution neural network according to the hospital autism diagnosis scale and diagnosis process this paper studies and designs an information system for the diagnosis of autism by facial expression data After the actual test of recruiting testers the recognition rate of the system is percent It can effectively distinguish whether the expression of children is normal or not It provides a practical information system for the diagnosis of autism This paper will continue to collect more children s facial expression data from different countries and regions as training samples to further improve the recognition rate of facial expressions The autism diagnosis information system designed in this study has the following important significance Autism can be diagnosed as early as possible by using this system The best time to treat autism is before the age of six The earlier the diagnosis of autism is made the less the treatment cost and the higher the probability of recovery Early diagnosis is of great value in alleviating the burden on families and society of autistic patients The system can be published in the form of app or web pages and disseminated through the Internet The system can be installed and used on different devices such as computers mobile phones tablets etc It has good applicability Through thisLHTsystem autism can be diagnosed conveniently and time can be saved for the early treatment of autism patients especially those in underdeveloped areas It can make the diagnosis of autism more objective The whole diagnosis process is completed by the system Because artificial intelligence technology is used to recognize facial expressions without human intervention the diagnosis results are objective and accurate Reduce the intensity of doctors work Before the system was used it took an hour for doctors to diagnose an autistic patient By using this system doctors can save a lot of time and pay attention to the treatment of autism The facial expression database used in the training of this system contains different races in the world Therefore this system can not only diagnose children in different countries and regions but also diagnose suspected autism patients all over the world This research designs the system according to the actual business The early design of the system adopts the suggestions of several doctors so it is designed and manufactured according to the actual needs of doctors Although there are some papers on autism diagnosis by facial expressions at home and abroad there are still few autism diagnosis systems developed which can be used in practice This paper uses the latest indepth learning technology to improve the accuracy of facial expression recognition Previous traditional techniques and methods have low recognition rate of facial expressions In recent years with the development of artificial intelligence technology and the improvement of computing speed the convolutional neural network has greatly improved the accuracy of facial expression recognition which is the innovation of this research in technology Facial expression database and its recognition technology Facial expression database Facial expression is an important way for peopl e to express their emotions In the social process facial expression is an important way to judge the attitude and inner feelings of the other party Lanlan Mehrabian found that in a conversation the change of facial expression played the most important role Of these percent are facial expressions percent are voic e and only percent are words Mei and Hu Compared with voice expression can convey more abundant information Recognition and understanding of facial expressions i s very important for communicating with others Shen et al In Ekman demonstrated through empirical research that human beings have six basic facial expression s happiness sadness anger fear disgust and surprise Ekman In subsequent studies neutral expression has also been added to the basic expression and it is gen erally believed that there are seven basic expressions in facial expression With the continuous development of computer software and hardware technology people have a deeper understanding of facial expression recognition technology In order to better study facial expression recognition technology many international research institutions have established standard facial expression databases the main facial expression databases are as follows JAFFE The database stores facial expression data of Japanese women It contains facial images of ten Japanese women There are seven types of facial expressions namely neutral happyFacial expressions for autism diagnosissad surprise anger disgust and fear The resolution of each image is pixels Everyone has seven kinds of pictures of facial expressions CK The expression database was collected under laboratory conditions It includes African Americans Asians and South Americans The resolution of each image is pixels It contains expression sequences of people percent of whom are female and percent are male Each sequence begins and ends with neutral expression which includes the process from calm to strong expression CK is a facial expression data set with many applications The reliability of various facial expression evaluation experiments using this database is very high It includes seven types of facial expressions anger contempt disgust fear happy sadness and surprise FER There are facial images in the library and there are seven facial expression types angry disgust fear happy sad surprise and neutral The resolution of each image is pixels All the images are gray images There are three sample sets images in the training set images in the validation set and images in the test set MMI The expression database can be divided into two parts one is a dynamic data set composed of more than video sequences The other part is a static data set consisting of a large number of high resolution images There are seven types of expression in the library AFEW All the facial images in the database are edited from the movies and contain seven basic facial expressions SFEW The expression library is a static frame image extracted from the AFEW data set which contains seven basic expressions Facial expression recognition process The process of facial expression recognition includes two stages as shown in Figure One is the training stage and the other is the recognition stage The training and recognition stages can be divided into three parts the pretreatment of facial expression images the extraction of facial expression features and the classification of facial expressions The training stage is to train the model in order to achieve the purpose that the model can be used The recognition stage is to recognize and classify the expression of the test image Du The two stages of expression recognition process include the following processes First face detection is carried out on the image in the expression database including the location Figure Facial expression recognition processLHTalignment and clipping of the face area This is the basis of the followup process Only when the expression area is accurately obtained the following series of work will be more accurate After the face area is detected the image needs to be preprocessed in order to eliminate the noise caused by the influence of acquisition equipment and environment and avoid the interference of feature extraction Then it is the feature extraction step which aims to extract the features that can represent the essence of expression from the preprocessed facial images In this process in order to avoid the high dimension of feature extraction and affect the efficiency of the algorithm we need to reduce the dimension of extracted features in order to extract the most representative expression features Finally the extracted facial features are classified to determine which type of facial expression is Facial expression recognition technology Facial expression recognition technology mainly includes traditional machine learning technology and deep learning technology The two technologies have similarities and different characteristics Traditional machine learning technology Facial expression recognition algorithm based on traditional machine learning includes three steps image preprocessing facial expression feature extraction and feature classification First for the convenience of feature extraction it is necessary to preprocess the image which can effectively avoid the interference of various noises and leave the key information needed by the face The pretreatment process includes image gray processing face alignment face size tailoring data enhancement brightness pose normalization etc Li and Deng Second the traditional feature extraction methods include directional gradient histogram feature Gabor filter feature local directional pattern feature and enhanced local binary algorithm Because these methods are artificial design timeconsuming and laborious and have certain limitations and often have better effect in feature extraction in small sample image set most of the current studies are based on deep learning feature extraction method There are many basic machine learning methods for expression classification such as support vector machine SVM hidden Markov model HMM and knearest classification algorithm Deep learning technology Facial expression recognition algorithm based on deep learning also needs image preprocessing The difference is that it often combines feature extraction and feature classification into an endtoend model which greatly simplifies the process of facial expression recognition In addition to endtoend learning deep learning algorithm can be used to extract facial expression features and then other independent classifiers can be used For example SVM or random forest algorithm is used to process the extracted features and classify them In this paper we construct a facial expression recognition model based on deep learning technology extract facial expression feature data of children and classify them into groups so as to diagnose autism Driving role of facial expression data Research on facial expression recognition has been applied in a series of life scenarios In children s education advanced humancomputer interaction medical diagnosis and other aspects have played an important role Cai In distance education or classroom teaching teachers can better improve students learning quality by observing students emotional changes in the classroom and adjustingFacial expressions for autism diagnosisteaching plans in time Advanced humancomputer interaction can make humancomputer interaction more harmonious For example intelligent robots can automatically respond to the facial expressions of their interlocutors In medical diagnosis facial expressions also play an important role in the prevention and diagnosis of diseases For example this article is to diagnose autism by analyzing children s facial expressions Autism and facial expression diagnosis Autism and its development Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder which is collectively referred to as autism spectrum disorder Duan et al Since Kanner an American child psychiatrist first reported autism in the incidence of autism has risen rapidly worldwide In the s about out of every people suffered from the disease while in out of every children suffered from the disease Vismara and Rogers According to the National Center for Health Statistics the probability of autism among children aged in the United States reached percent in Zablotsky et al There is no statistical survey on autistic children in China However according to the data of the report on the development of China s autism education and rehabilitation industry II the number of people with autism in China is estimated to exceed million of which million are autistic children At the same time it is growing at the rate of nearly annually Beijing Wucai Deer Autism Research Institute Autism brings serious financial burden to both society and family Families with autistic children on the one hand spend a lot of time caring for their children while working hours are reduced so that work income is reduced On the other hand the cost of family rehabilitation treatment for autistic children is huge which increases the family s financial burden Wu and Chen According to the survey on the occupational and economic burden of preschool autistic children s families percent of parents of autistic children reported that their caregiving problems seriously affected their careers and their annual income was significantly lower than that of ordinary families with an average loss of income of yuan per year Meanwhile the average annual cost of autistic children s families for children s education and training is significantly higher than that of ordinary families Yang and Wang The society and the government also need to invest a lot of money in the rehabilitation education of autistic children At the same time autism also brings high subjective load and depression to the families of patients which has a negative impact on their quality of life Singh et al Wang et al It can be seen that the incidence of autism in children is relatively serious and the harm to society and family is enormous Diagnosis of autism through facial expressions Facial expression recognition disorder Autistic children have facial expression recognition obstacles which are mainly manifested in their inability to recognize facial expressions Liuet al It is easy to distinguish autistic children from normal children by observing their facial expressions Therefore we combine facial expression recognition technology to extract facial expression response feature vectors and use artificial intelligence technology to distinguish normal group and autistic group based on these facial features The principle of diagnosing autism through facial expressions A large number of studies have pointed out that autistic patients have deficiencies in facial expression recognition and understanding This is the core source of impaired social function in autistic patients Yang et al Autistic children are more difficult to identify other people s emotional behavior and it is difficult to make appropriate judgment and responseLHTShen et al Overseas research on facial expression recognition ability of autistic patients has been carried out not only in children but also in adults Most studies believe that the ability of facial expression recognition of autistic patients is low BaronCohen et al used standard facial expression maps to study the recognition of different emotional types in autistic adults It was found that autistic adults had better recognition of some basic facial expressions such as happiness but relatively complex facial expressions such as surprise recognition were difficult to recognize At present the main diagnostic criteria of autism are IDC DSMIV the autism child behavior scale ABC the children autism rating scale CARS and the Clancy behavior scale CABS Wang After consulting a large number of literatures and investigating the actual situation of the hospital now the hospital mainly uses CABS filled by parents ABC filled by parents and CARS filled by doctors to diagnose autism After a detailed review of the test items of the three scales these scales all contain the test items to judge autism through children s facial expressions There were items in the CABS scale of which the seventh item was inexplicable laughter and the tenth item was not looking at each other s face Avoiding eye contact was related to expression There were items in the ABC scale of which the seventh item was noncommunicative smile the seventeenth item did not respond to other people s facial expressions and the twentyfourth item was active avoidance of eye contact with others Fifteen items of the CARS scale the third of which is emotional response pleasure and unhappiness and interest are expressed by changes in facial expression and posture These scales basically include the items of autism detection by children s facial expressions which show that the diagnosis of autism can be more accurate by facial expressions With the progress of artificial intelligence technology facial expression recognition technology can objectively and effectively reflect the mental health of children and can be used in early diagnosis of autism Yanbin et al We also communicated with doctors of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital Wuhan Children s Hospital and Guangzhou Women and Children s Medical Center many times and actually checked the process of using the above autism diagnostic scale to diagnose children The doctor observes the tester s reaction to determine whether the tester is autistic after requesting the tester to make the corresponding expression Doctors point out that facial expression is an important part of autism diagnosis In terms of system design they put forward requirements and suggestions for the process of diagnosing autism through facialexpression Research and development of autism diagnosis information system Facial expression database selection The expression databases in this study mainly come from two public expression databases CKand FER In addition Chinese children s expression data were collected as supplementary samples The two public expression databases are standard and international and have been widely used including facial expression data of adults and children Each sample in the database contains seven expressions angry disgust fear happy sad surprise and neutral Because children s facial expressions are different from adults in order to improve the recognition rate of children s facial expressions we collected facial expression data of children aged to in China Seven expressions were collected from each child We combine Chinese children s facial expression data and public expression database as our system s facial expression database FER facial expression database The reason for choosing FER expression database is that it has more samples and is more mature than other expression databases It has advantages in model training At the same time it has been used in many studies see Plate Facial expressions for autism diagnosis CK Facial expression database CKfacial expression database was selected because it was collected in the laboratory so its accuracy is relatively high Lucey et al seePlate Facial expression data of Chinese children At present the mature facial expression databases at home and abroad are mainly based on adult male or female facial expression images Therefore it is urgent to establish a facial expression database for children Facial images of children are quite diffe rent from those of adults Children have rounder faces larger eyes and less prominent bones Because of these differences children s facial features are less obvious and more difficult to recognize than adults Because of the particularity of children it is very difficult to collect children sf a c i a l images In order to improve the recognition rate of children s facial expressions we cooperated with Amy Education School in Zhengzhou Sixteen healthy children as volunteers were recruited to collect facial expression data Each of them collected seven kinds of expressions totaling pictures These children are between and years old including boys and girls The acquisition environment is quiet and there is no external interference Highd efinition cameras are used t o collect facial expression images which are processed professionally Bef ore collecting facial expression data parents have been informed of the purpose o f collecting facial expression data After questioning with parents all the children who participated in the collection of facial expression data had no history of autism We loaded the expression data into the training sample library The purpose of collecting Chinese children s facial expression data is to increase the number of Chinese children s facial expression samples in training samples and improve the recognition rate of the system for children s facial expression The collection process and the collected children s facial expression data are shown in Plate Network topology According to the network environment and equipment of the information service platform the network topology can be divided into four levels The network topology diagram is shown inFigure The first layer is the application layer which consists of users computers and various smart devices Smart devices include smart tablet computer smartphones and other electronic devices Users access and use the information service platform through computers and various smart devices Plate FER facialexpression database Plate CKFacial expression databaseLHTThe second layer is the communication layer mainly based on the internet network environment providing access channels for users and systems The third layer is the application server layer which is composed of firewall and application server and has an ontology display system for autism The application server manages various business functions handles various business requests submitted by users and can access the database server for various data exchange The fourth layer is the database server layer which stores all kinds of data and knowledge resources of the information service platform System architecture The smart diagnosis system of autism adopts clientserver architecture The client includes different versions of programs suitable for computers and smartphones The system architecture diagram is shown in Figure The client includes three main modules user interaction image acquisition and face detection User interaction module is responsible for humancomputer interaction According to the requirements of the autism diagnostic scale users who diagnose are required to make appropriate expressions and feedback by prompting pictures and voice guidance Through the camera the image acquisition module can dynamically capture facial expression images At the right time the system will collect facial expression images and transmit them to the face detection module Face detection module recognizes the valid face features and compresses the image and transfers it to the server through the internet or mobile Internet The server includes six main modules image processing feature extraction group classification automatic diagnosis training model and data management The image processing module can receive the expression image transmitted by the client and then process the expression image and transfer it to other modules on the server side The feature extraction module receives the facial expression images provided by the image processing module and extracts the facial expression features The group classification module is Figure Network topology diagramPlate Collection of facial expression data of Chinese childrenFacial expressions for autism diagnosisresponsible for group classification and correctly classifies the expression images into the most matching expressions among the seven kinds of expressions The automatic diagnosis module gives the diagnosis of autism by comparing the facial expressions that the tester is required to imitate and the facial expressions that the tester actually makes Model training module is the core module of the system which is responsible for recognizing and processing the newly collected facial expression images The data management module mainly manages facial expression data including storing and reading facial expression images transmitted by the client The system server stores facial expression feature files which are formed by feature extraction of facial expression database The expression feature file is HDF file format The expression recognition system running on the server can read the expression feature file at any time If new facial expression samples are collected the model can be retrained and the facial expression feature files can be updated The client collects the tester s facial expression data by highdefinition camera and transmits the facial expression data to the server by JSON file according to TCP communication protocol The facial expression recognition system running on the server processes the collected facial expression data and then feeds the recognition results back to the tester through the network and stores the recognition results and facial expression data in the server database Facial data and diagnostic system are stored on a server and the recognition results and facial data are stored in the SQL Server database The diagnostic system reads data from the database through SQL structured query language The response time of the whole database operation and communication process should not exceed s System architecture VGG model Researchers from the Oxford University and the Google Brain have jointly developed the convolutional neural network VGG VGNet consists of and layers of neural networks VGNet constructs layers of neural networks by stacking small convolution cores of and maximum pooling layers of repeatedly VGGNet Figure System architectureLHThas strong scalability and greatly reduces the error rate when extending When migrating to other image data it has good generalization ability and simple structure ResNet model ResNet was proposed by Kaiming He and others of Microsoft Research institute They have successfully trained layers of neural networks by using ResNet unit The structure of ResNet can accelerate the training of the neural network and the accuracy of the model has been greatly improved Graphic of deep learning framework The deep learning framework used in this paper for facial expression recognition is shown in Plate The whole process includes image input image preprocessing model building model training model testing and output of expression recognition results There are two kinds of deep learning algorithms used in this paper VGG and ResNet ResNet solves the problem of network performance degradation caused by the high depth of VGG By training the two models and synthesizing the two convolutional neural network models the facial expression features of autistic children can be extracted accurately Image preprocessing The purpose of image preprocessing is to achieve uniform normalization of the final input image The process is shown in Figure Converting an image to a grayscale image can reduce the computational complexity of the latter pixel level and also reflect the overall and local distribution and characteristics of the image Then image transformation is used to enhance data by zooming rotating cutting and translating and the image is located in the center of the window The contrast and brightness of the image can be improved by histogram equalization to reduce the influence of illumination on expression feature learning In order to make the image uniform it is planned to transform the image size into the same size by normalizing the image size Finally the mask is used to remove the occlusion of nonface areas Model training Before model training we need to enhance the image data We choose SGD random gradient descent algorithm as the optimization method The batch size is still by default and the learning rate is set to initially In addition the initialization of Plate Framework of deep learning Figure Image preprocessingFacial expressions for autism diagnosisPlate Facial expression recognition resultsLHTnetwork parameters is also very

facial expression After testing the recognition rate of children s facial expression reaches percent which can effectively distinguish whether children s facial expression is normal or not System

testing Test sample We recruited ten normal children and ten autistic children and divided them into normal children group and autistic children group for comparative verification The accuracy of the system is verified by the actual test of the autism diagnosis information system The normal group of children was provided by Amy Education School in Zhengzhou which cooperated with us Ten healthy

who participated in the experiment had no history of autism after being asked by their parents The autistic children were provided by Guangzhou Children s Care Center which cooperated with us Ten volunteers of autistic children were recruited as the autistic children group for testing These children were aged between and years old including boys and girls Parents were informed of the purpose and content of the experiment before the experiment The selected children with autism were diagnosed by a professional physician Test environment and process All the tests were conducted in quiet classrooms without noise and external factors Through our autism diagnosis information system each child was prompted by pictures and sounds to imitate seven kinds of facial expressions and prompted to make corresponding facial responses according to the facial expressions on the pictures At this time the camera will capture their facial expressions and after system analysis they will be saved in the form of pictures in the computer of the test system see Plate Test result We used the system to test the normal combination and autistic children respectively Finally we compared the recognition rate of the two groups From Table II the average recognition rate of each expression is angry percent disgust percent fear percent happy percent sad percent surprise percent and neutral percent Test

percent percent percent percent percent percent percent and percent respectively The average recognition rate is percent Judging by the percent threshold there are two test children s facial expression recognition rates at percent This shows that in real environment the algorithm of the system is affected by the environment and light and the accuracy will be affected to a certain extent However according to the accuracy of percent it can basically meet the preliminary diagnostic requirements of whether the expression is abnormal or not In the future more real samples will be added to further improve the accuracy of the system algorithm The experimental results show that the errors mainly concentrate on the expressions of disgust and surprise The main reasons are as follows Disgust and surprise have only minor local changes in the faces of the two kinds of expressions and there is no significant distinguishing feature Some of the participants had little change in the two facial expressions did not have the obvious features of the corresponding categories approached neutral expressions and were easy to confuse From Table III the average recognition rate of each expression is angry percent disgust percent fear percent happy percent sad percent surprise percent and neutral percent The average recognition rates of the seven expressions from test child to test child were

Comparisons of two groups of children s facial expression recognition rateLHTThe experimental results show that the recognition rate of happiness and sadness is higher in the seven expressions Testing children showed difficulty in identifying complex facial expressions such as neutrality and aversion see Table IV The experimental results showed that the recognition rate of facial expressions in autistic children was significantly lower than that in normal children All the autistic children who participated in the test had a facial recognition rate of less than percent Therefore if the accuracy rate of facial expression diagnosis by the system was less than percent the tester would have a tendency to suffer from autism The lower the recognition rate the higher the tendency of autism Conclusion In the era of rapid development of information technology the processing of a large number of health data has brought new opportunities and challenges to medical research The incidence of autism is increasing which has attracted more and more attention from all aspects of society The use of information technology especially artificial intelligence technology to build an autism diagnosis system has become an urgent need for doctors and patients In this paper an autism diagnosis system based on deep convolution neural network and expression data is constructed After testing it can meet the design requirements of autism diagnosis The public can download and use the system through the network to diagnose autism conveniently In addition we will expand the function of the system increase the recognition of children s physical movement and realize the diagnosis of autism from multiple perspectives Because the average age of children using and collecting facial expression data is between and years old the system can recognize children aged years old Therefore through this system autism can be diagnosed as soon as possible The earlier the diagnosis and treatment of autism is the better the rehabilitation effect Therefore it is of great significance for the treatment of autism Because the training samples of the system adopt the international open facial expression database which contains the facial expression data of children and adults in different countries and regions the system can diagnose autism for children and adults in different countries and regions Of course the system also needs to be improved through practical use Next we will arrange for the system to be tested in a large number of cooperative hospitals Next there are two main tasks to be done The first is to collect more data of normal and autistic children s facial expressions improve the recognition effect of the system on children s facial expressions and establish a special database of children s facial expressions The second is to improve the system function according to the results of facial expression diagnosis of autistic children for a detailed classification to distinguish between severe moderate and mild autism patients in order to facilitate the treatment of doctors This study hopes to be helpful to the diagnosis of autism in remote and underdeveloped areas so as to promote the early diagnosis and treatment of autistic children and reduce the medical costs and burdens of autistic families and society Therefore this study has more
