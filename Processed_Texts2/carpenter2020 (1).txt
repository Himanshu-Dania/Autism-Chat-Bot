RESEARCH ARTICLE Digital Behavioral Phenotyping Detects Atypical Pattern of Facial Expression in Toddlers with Autism Kimberly L H Carpenter Jordan Hahemi Kathleen Campbell Steven J Lippmann Jeffrey P Baker Helen L Egger Steven Espinosa Saritha Vermeer Guillermo Sapiro and Geraldine Dawson Commonly used screening tools for autism spectrum disorder ASD generally rely on subjective caregiver questionnaires While behavioral observation is more objective it is also expensive timeconsuming and requires signi cant expertise to perform As such there remains a critical need to develop feasible scalable and reliable tools that can characterize ASD risk behaviors This study assessed the utility of a tabletbased behavioral assessment for eliciting and detecting one type of risk behavior namely patterns of facial expression in toddlers ASD N and evaluated whether such patterns differentiated toddlers with and without ASD The assessment consisted of the child sitting on hisher caregiver s lap and watching brief movies shown on a smart tablet while the embedded camera recorded the child s facial expressions Com puter vision analysis CVA automatically detected and tracked facial landmarks which were used to estimate head position and facial expressions Positive Neutral All Other Using CVA speci c points throughout the movies were identi ed that reliably differentiate between children with and without ASD based on their patterns of facial movement and expressions area under the curves for individual movies ranging from to During these instances children with ASD more frequently displayed Neutral expressions compared to children without ASD who had more All Other expressions The frequency of All Other expressions was driven by nonASD children more often displaying raised eyebrows and an open mouth characteristic of engagementinterest Preliminary results suggest computational coding of facial movements and expressions via a tabletbased assessment can detect differences

behavioral assessment of young children with autism Children watched a series of developmentally appropriate movies and their facial expressions were recorded using the camera embedded in the tablet Results suggest that computational assessments of facial expressions may be useful in early detec tion of symptoms of autism Keywords autism risk behaviors facial expressions computer vision early detection Introduction Autism spectrum disorder ASD can be reliably diagnosed as early as months old and the risk signs can be detected as early as months old Dawson Bernier Luyster et al Despite this the aver age age of diagnosis in the United States remains around years of age Christensen et al While there is mixed evidence for the stability of autism traits over early childhood Bieleninik et al WaizbardBartov et al the delay in diagnosis can still impact timely intervention during a critical window of development Inresponse to this in the American Academy of Pedi atrics published guidelines

expressions with others Adrien et al Baranek S Clifford Dissanayake S Clifford Young Williamson S M Clifford Dissanayake Maestro et al Osterling Dawson Munson Werner Dawson Osterling Dinno A restricted range of emotional expres sion and its integration with eye gaze eg during socialreferencing have been found to differentiate children with ASD from typically developing children as well as

age cognitive ability and language one of the most stable symptoms from early childhood through adolescencesis increased frequency of neutral expression Bal Kim Fok Lord As such differences in facial affect may show utility in assessing early risk for ASD A recent metaanalysis of facial expression production in autism found that individuals with ASD display facial expressions less often than nonASD participants andthat when they did display facial expressions the expres sions occurred for shorter durations and were of different quality than nonASD individuals Trevisan Hoskyn Birmingham Decreases in the frequency of both emotional facial expressions and the sharing of those expressions with others has been demonstrated acrossnaturalistic interactions Bieberich Morgan Czapinski Bryson

from chil dren with other delays Bieberich Morgan Yirmiya Kasari Sigman Mundy As such fre quency and duration of facial affect is a promising early risk marker for young children with autism Previous research on atypical facial expressions in chil dren with ASD has relied on hand coding of facial expres sions which is time intensive and often requiressignicant training Bieberich Morgan S Clifford et al Dawson et al Gangi et al Mcgee et al Nichols et al Snowet al This approach is not scalable for use in gen eral ASD risk screening or as a behavioral biomarker or outcome assessment for use in large clinical trials Assuch the eld has moved toward automating the coding of facial expressions In one of the earliest studies of this approach Guha and colleagues demonstrated that children with ASD have atypical facial expressions when mimicking others However their technology required the children to wear markers on their face for data capture Guha Yang Grossman Narayanan Guha et al which is both invasive and not scalable More recently several groups have applied noninvasiveCVA technology to measuring affect in older children and adults with ASD within the laboratory setting CapriolaHall et al Owada et al Samadet al This represents an important move toward scalability as CVA approaches do not rely on the presence of physical markers on the face to extract emotion information Rather CVA relies on videos of the individual in which features around speci c regions on a face eg the mouth and eyes are extracted Notably these featuresmirror those used by the manually rated facial affect cod ing system FACS Ekman Both our earlier work Hashemi et al and that of others CapriolaHallet al have shown good concordance between human coding and CVA rating of facial emotions Fur thermore previous research in adults has demonstratedthat CVA can detect neutral facial expressions more reli ably than human coders Lewinski Building on previous work applying CVA in laboratory settings we have developed a portable tabletbased tech nology that uses the embedded camera and automatic CVA to code ASD risk behaviors in min across a rangeof nonlaboratory settings eg pediatric clinics at home etc We developed a series of movies designed to capture children s attention elicit emotion in response to novel and interesting events and assess the toddler s ability to sustain attention and share it with others By embedding INSAR Carpenter et alDigital behavioral phenotyping in ASD these movies in a fully automated system on a cost effective tablet whereby the elicited behaviors in thiscase the frequency of different patterns of facial affect are automatically encoded with CVA we aim to create a tool that is objective ef cient and accessible The cur rent analysis focuses on preliminary results supporting the utility of this tabletbased assessment for the detec tion of facial movement and affect in young children andthe use of facial affect to differentiate children with and without ASD Though facial affect is the focus of the cur rent analysis the ultimate goal is to combine informationacross autism risk features collected through the current digital screening tool eg delayed response to name as described in Campbell et al to develop a risk scorebased on multiple behaviors Dawson Sapiro This information could then be combined with addi tional measures of risk to enhance screening for ASD Methods Participants Participants were children months of age Table Children were recruited at their pediatric pri mary care visit by a research assistant embedded within the clinic or via referral from their physician as well asthrough community advertisement N in the non ASD group and N in the ASD group For children recruited within the pediatric clinics recruitmentoccurred at the or month wellchild visit at the same time as they received standard screening for ASD with the MCHATRF A total of of the participantsrecruited in the clinic by a research assistant chose to par ticipate Of the participants who chose not to participate indicated that they were not interested in the studywhereas the remainder declined due to not having enough time having another child to take care of wanting to discuss with their partner or their child was already too distressed after the physician visit All chil dren who enrolled in the study found the procedureengaging enough that they were able to provide adequate data for analysis Because the administration is very brief and nondemanding data loss was not a signi cant problem Exclusionary criteria included known vision or hearing decits lack of exposure to English at home or insuf cient English language skills for caregiver s informed con sent Twentytwo children were diagnosed with ASD The nonASD comparison group N was comprised of typically developing children and children with a nonASD delay which was de ned by a diagnosis of lan guage delay or developmental delay of clinical signi cance suf cient to qualify for speech or developmental therapy as recorded in the electronic medical record All caregiverslegal guardians gave written informed consentand the study protocol was approved by the Duke Uni versity Health System IRB Children recruited from the pediatric primary care settings received screening with a digital version of the MCHATRF as part of a quality improvement study ongoing in the clinic Campbell et al Participantsrecruited from the community received ASD screening with the digital MCHATRF prior to the tablet assess ment As part of their

children betweenthe two groups P When looking only at the children for which Medicaid status was known there was no difference in the proportion ofchildren on Medicaid in the ASD and the nonASD group P Stimuli and Procedure A series of developmentally appropriate brief movies designed to elicit affect and engage the child s attention were shown on a tablet while the child sat on a care givers lap The tablet was placed on a stand approxi mately ft away from the child to prevent the child fromtouching the screen as depicted in previous publications Campbell et al Dawson et al Hashemi et al Hashemi et al Movies consisted ofcascading bubbles sec a mechanical bunny sec animal puppets interacting with each other sec and a split screen showing a woman singingnursery rhymes on one side and dynamic noisemaking toys on the other side sec Fig These movies included stimuli that have been used in previous studiesof ASD symptomatology Murias et al as well as developed speci cally for the current tabletbased tech nology to elicit autism symptoms based on Dawsonet al Jones Dawson Kelly Estes and Webb Jones et al and Luyster et al At three points during the movies the examiner located behind the child called the child s name Prior to the administration of the app caregivers were clearly instructed not to direct their child s attention or in any way try to in uence the child s behavior during the assessment Furthermore if the caregiver began to tryto direct their child s attention the examiner in the room immediately asked the caregiver to refrain from doing so If the caregiver persisted this was noted on our validity form and the administration would have been consid ered invalid Researchers stopped the task for one comparison participant due to crying Researchersrestarted the task for three participants with ASD due to difculty remaining in view of the tablet s camera for more than half of the rst video stimulus If other family members were present during the wellchild visit they were asked to stand behind the caregiver and child so as to not distract the child during the assessment Additionally for children assessed during a wellchild visit research assistants were instructed to collect data prior to any planned shots or blood draws Computer Vision Analysis The frontal camera in the tablet recorded video through out the experiment at resolution and frames per second The CVA algorithm Hashemi et al rst automatically detected and tracked facial landmarks on the child s face De la Torre et al Head positions relative to the camera were estimated by computing the optimal rotation parametersbetween the detected landmarks and a D canonical face model Fischler Bolles A not visible tag was assigned to frames where the face was not detected or theface exhibited drastic yaw Cfrom center We acknowledge that the current method used only indicates whether the child is oriented toward the stimulus anddoes not track eye movements For each visible frame the probability of expressing three standard categories of facial expressions Positive Neutral ie no active facial Figure Example of movie stimuli Developmentally appropriate movies consisted of cascading bubbles a mechanical bunny animal puppets interacting with each other and a split screen showing a woman singing nursery rhymes on one side and dynamic noisemakingtoys on the other side INSAR Carpenter et alDigital behavioral phenotyping in ASD action unit or Other all other expressions was assigned Hashemi et al The model for automaticfacial expression is an extension of the poseinvariant and crossmodal dictionary learning approach originally described in Hashemi et al During training thedictionary representation is setup to map facial informa tion between D and D modalities and is then able to infer discriminative facial information for facial expressions recognition even when only D facial images are available at deployment For training data from Bing hamton University D Facial Expression database YinWei Sun Wang Rosato were used along with synthesized faces images with varying poses see Hashemi et al for synthesis details Extracted image featuresand distances between a subset of facial landmarks were used as facial features to learn the robust dictionary Lastly using the inferred discriminative D and frontalD facial features a multiclass support vector machine Chang Lin was trained to classify the different facial expressions In recent years there has been progress on automatic facial expression analysis of both children and toddlers Dys Malti Gadea AlioEspert Salvador Haines et al LoBue Thrasher Messinger Mahoor Chow Cohn In addition to this we have previouslyvalidated our CVA algorithm against expert human rater coding of facial affect in a subsample of video record ings across participants ASD nonASD This represents of the nonASD sample and a mat ched group from the ASD sample The selection of partici pants for this previously published validation study wasbased on age distribution to ensure representation across the range of ages for both nonASD and ASD groups This previous work showed strong concordance between CVAand humanrated coding of facial emotion in this data set with high precision recall and F scores of and respectively Hashemi et al Statistical Approach For each video frame the CVA algorithm produces a probability value for each expression Positive Neutral Other We calculated the mean of the probability values for each of the three expression types within nonoverlapping frame sec intervals excluding frames when the face was not visible A sec window was selected as it provided us with a continuous distributionof the emotion probabilities while still being within the sec window of a macroexpression Ekman Additionally for each of the name call events weremoved the time window starting at cue for the name call prompt through the point where of the audible name calls actually occurred plus frames sec Thiswindow was selected based on our previous studyCampbell et al showing that orienting tended to occur within a few seconds after a name call We calculated the proportion of frames the child was not attend ing to the movie stimulus based on the visible and not visible tags described above within each frame interval excluding name call periods Thus for each child we generated four variables mean probabilities of Positive Neutral or Other and proportion of frames notattending for each frame interval within each of the ve movies To evaluate differences between ASD and nonASD children at regular intervals throughout the assessment wet a series of bivariate logistic regressions to obtain the odds ratios for the associations between the meanexpression probability or attending proportion during a given interval parameterized as increments of points and ASD diagnosis We then t a series of multi variable logistic regression models separately for each movie and variable which included parameters for each of the sec intervals within the movie to predict ASDdiagnosis Given the large number of intervals relative to the small sample size we used a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator LASSO penalized regressionapproach Tibshirani to select a parsimonious set of parameters representing the intervals within each movie and expression type that were most predictive ofASD diagnosis For each of the ve movies we then combined the LASSOselected interval parameters into a full logisticmodel When more than one expression parameter was selected for a given interval we selected the one with the stronger odds ratio estimate Analyses were conductedwith and without age as a covariate Since the small study size precluded having separate training and validation sets we used leaveoneout crossvalidation to assessmodel performance Receiveroperating characteristics ROC curves were plotted and the cstatistic for the area under the ROC curve was calculated for each movie Results Figure depicts the odds ratio analysis using theRhymes and Toys movie as one illustrative example As shown by the variability in the odds ratio estimates some parts of the movies elicited strongly differential responsesin certain patterns of expression blue window Fig while in other sections there were not substantial differ ences between the two groups green

models after leaveoneout cross validation ROC curves analyses were performed for eachvideo individually The model for the Rhymes movie yielded the strongest predictive ability with an area under the curve AUC of con dence interval CI followed by the Puppets AUC CI and the Bunny AUC CI videos Finally the two Bubbles movies that bookend the stimulus sets were the least predictive with AUCs of CI and CI respectively Because there was a signi cant difference in age between the ASD and nonASD com parison groups we ran a second set of ROC analyses where age was included as a covariate shown in Table Results remained signi cant after including the age covariate Given the preponderance for the Other emotional cate gory in our nonASD comparison group we explored a what speci c facial movements are driving this cate gory of Other expressions and b how it differs from theNeutral expression category We focused on analyzing movements of facial landmarks and head pose angles and how they differ between the facial expression categoriesOur CVA algorithm aligns the facial landmarks of the child to a canonical face model through an af ne trans formation which normalizes the landmark locationsacross all video frames to a common space This normali zation process is commonly used across CVA tasks related to facial analysis as it allows one to analyzecomparelandmark locations across different frames or partici pants With this alignment step we were able to quantify the distances between the eye corners and the corners ofthe eyebrows the vertical distance between the inner lip points and the vertical distance between the outer lip points Fig right To interpret features that differentiated the Neutral from the Other facial expression cate gory we assessed differences between these facial landmark distances of a given child when they were predominately expressing Neutral versus Other facial expres sions We also included yaw and pitch head pose angles since they may play a role in the alignment process Figure Time series of odds ratios for the association between the mean expression probability or proportion attending and ASD diagnosis Using the Rhymes movie as one

poseangles Discussion The present study evaluated an application administeredon a tablet that was comprised of carefully designed movies that elicited affective expressions combined with CVA of recorded behavioral responses to identify patternsof facial movement and emotional expression that differ entiate toddlers with ASD from those without ASD We demonstrated that the movies elicited a range of affectivefacial expressions in both groups Furthermore using CVA we found children with ASD were more likely to dis play a neutral expression than children without ASDwhen watching this series of videos and the patterns of facial expressions elicited during speci c parts of the movies differed between the two groups We believe thisnding has strong face validity that rests on both research and clinical observations of a restricted range of facial expression in children with autism Furthermorethis replicates a previous nding of our group reporting increased frequency of neutral expression in young children who screened positive on the MCHATEgger et al Together these preliminary resultssupport the use of engaging brief movies shown on a costeffective tablet combined with automated CVAbehavioral coding as an objective and feasible tool for measuring an early emerging symptom of ASD namely increased frequency of neutral facial expressions While the predictive power of emotional expression in some of the videos varied all but one represent a medium effect equivalent to Cohen sd or greater Rice Harris Overall the best predictor from our battery of videos is the Rhymes video which had an AUC with a large effect size equivalent to d While this may suggest that presenting the Rhymes video alone is suf cient for differentiating between the ASD and nonASD groups we caution readers from coming to this conclusion for two reasons First it is possible that had we had a larger sample the other videos would have had a larger effect Second we anticipate that there will be variabilityin the ASD group with regard to which features a single child will express and different videos may be better suited to elicit different features in any given individualAs such we believe that it is important to understand how each independent feature in this case facial affect performs across the different videos so that we can beingto build better predictive models from combinations of features eg facial affect and postural sway as described in Dawson et al To further understand the difference of facial expres sion in the nonASD group as compared to our ASD sam ple we explored the facial landmarks differentiatingbetween the Other facial expression category that domi nated the nonASD control group versus the Neutral facial expression which was more common in the ASDgroup Through this analysis we identi ed the features of raised eyebrows and open mouth to play a role in dis criminating between the Other vs Neutral categoriesThis facial pattern is consistent with an engagedinter ested look displayed when a child is actively watching as described in young children by Sullivan and Lewis It is interesting to note a raised pitch angle was also statis tically signi cant Since the median difference of this angle between the two facial expression is small C this may be a natural movement of raising one s eyebrows Our results need to be considered in light of several limitations First the CVA models of facial expressions used in the current study were trained on adult faces Hashemi et al Despite this our previous ndings with young children demonstrate good concordance between human and CVA coding on the designation of facial expressions Hashemi et al Furthermorethe Other facial expression category includes all non positive or negative expressions As such even though we were able to determine the predominant feature driving those expressions was the raised eyebrows which is in line with our observations from watching the moviesTable Comparison of ASD Versus NonASD Area Under the Curve AUC Analyses AUC without covariates AUC with age in the model Bubbles Bunny Puppets Rhymes Bubbles INSAR Carpenter et alDigital behavioral phenotyping in ASD it is possible that there are a combination of facial expres sions in the nonASD group driving this designation Future studies will need to train on the engagedinterested facial expression speci cally and test the robustness of this nding Additionally though we have previously demonstrated good reliability between our CVA algorithms and human coding of emotions Hashemi et al future validation of our CVA analysis of emotional facial expressions in larger datasets is currentlyunderway Second using the LASSO statistical approach means our model may not select all features that have dif ferentiating information However we selected thisapproach because it minimizes over tting the model Third our sample size was relatively small and we do not have separate training and testing samples To accountfor this we applied crossvalidation on the ROC curves even though this decreased the performance metrics of the model This suggests that our ROC results are potentially conservative Finally our comparison group con tains both children with typical development and children with nonASD developmental delays a factorthat can be viewed as both a weakness and a strength Previous research has demonstrated that increased fre quency of neutral expressions does differentiate childrenwith ASD from those with other developmental delays Bieberich Morgan Yirmiya et al How ever due to the small sample size of children with nonASD developmental delays we were unable to directly test this in our data Furthermore because only a subset of the sample received an assessment of cognitive abilityit is possible that there were additional children in the nonASD comparison group that also had a developmen tal delay that was undetected Ongoing research in a prospective longitudinal study with larger samples is underway to further parse the ability of our CVA tools to differentiate between children with ASD children with anonASD developmental delay andor attention de cit hyperactivity disorder and typically developing children While a difference in facial expression is one core fea ture of ASD the heterogeneity in ASD means we do not expect all children with ASD to display this sign of ASD As such our next step is to combine the current resultswith other measures of autism risk assessed through the current digital screening tool including response to name Campbell et al postural sway Dawsonet al and differential vocalizations Tenenbaum et al among other features to develop a risk score based on multiple behaviors Dawson Sapiro Since no one child is expected to display every risk behav ior a goal is to determine thresholds based on the total number of behaviors regardless of which combination ofbehaviors to asses for risk This is similar to what is done in commonly used screening and diagnostic tools such as the MCHAT Robins et al Autism Diagnostic Figure Analysis of Other Facial Expression The panels on the left depict heat maps of aligned landmarks across ASD and nonASD participants when they were exhibiting Neutral and other facial expressions the color bar indicates proportion of frames where landmarks were displayed in a given image location The single panel on the right is an example of the landmark distances explored INSAR Carpenter et alDigital behavioral phenotyping in ASD Interview Lord Rutter Le Couteur and ADOS Gotham Risi Pickles Lord Lord et al In summary we evaluated an integrated objective tool for the elicitation and measurement of facial movements and expressions in toddlers with and without ASD Thecurrent study adds to a body of research supporting digi tal behavioral phenotyping as a viable method for assessing autism risk behaviors Our goal is to furtherdevelop and validate this tool so that it can eventually be used within the context of current standard of care to enhance autism screening in pediatric populations Acknowledgments Funding for this work was provided by NIH RMH Sapiro Dawson PIs NIH ROMH Dawson Sapiro PIs
