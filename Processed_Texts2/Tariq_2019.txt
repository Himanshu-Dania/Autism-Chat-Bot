behaviors can span multiple appointments with trained clinicians and take several hours to complete In our previous work we demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning classifiers to accelerate the process by collecting home videos of USbased children identifying a reduced subset of behavioral features that are scored by untrained raters using a machine learning classifier to determine childrens risk scores for autism We achieved an accuracy of CI on US videos using a classifier built on five features Objective PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children Using videos of Bangladeshi children collected from Dhaka Shishu Childrens Hospital we aim to scale our pipeline to another culture and other developmental delays including speech and language conditions Methods Although our previously published and validated pipeline and set of classifiers perform reasonably well on Bangladeshi videos accuracy CI this work improves on that accuracy through the development and application of a powerful new technique for adaptive aggregation of crowdsourced labels We enhance both the utility and performance of our model by building two classification layers The first layer distinguishes between typical and atypical behavior and the second layer distinguishes between ASD and nonASD In each of the layers we use a unique rater weighting scheme to aggregate classification scores from different raters based on their expertise We also determine Shapley values for the most important features in the classifier to understand how the classifiers process aligns with clinical intuition Results Using these techniques we achieved an accuracy area under the curve AUC of SD and sensitivity of SD for identifying atypical children from among developmentally delayed children and an accuracy AUC of SD and sensitivity of SD for identifying children with ASD from those predicted to have other developmental delays Conclusions These results show promise for using a mobile videobased and machine learningdirected approach for early and remote detection of autism in Bangladeshi children This strategy could provide important resources for developmental health in developing countries with few clinical resources for diagnosis helping children get access to care at an early age Future research aimed at extending the application of this approach to identify a range of other conditions and determine the populationlevel burden of developmental disabilities and impairments will be of high value Keywords autism autism spectrum disorder machine learning developmental delays clinical resources Bangladesh Biomedical Data Science Introduction Autism spectrum disorder ASD is a heterogeneous developmental disorder that includes deficits in social communication repetitive behaviors and restrictive interests all of which lead to significant social and occupational impairments throughout the lifespan Autism is one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the United States affecting in children Although the global autism prevalence is largely unknown the prevalence is estimated to be between and among children in developing countries such as Bangladesh with a higher prevalence in urban centers eg in Dhaka These numbers only represent a fraction of the actual cases as most cases in semiurban and rural areas go unnoticed due to a dearth of resources The disparity between urban and rural prevalence may reflect poorly understood risk factors or clinical resources in highincome areas along with higher awareness among urban parents about developmental delays More accessible and widescale screening is needed to accurately estimate ASD prevalence in remote parts of Bangladesh and other countries The current models for diagnosing autism in Bangladesh as in the United States are often administered by trained clinical professionals using standard assessments Empirically validated diagnostic tools like the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS and Autism Diagnostic Interview ADIR are not always used in different countries particularly in developing countries as these tools are expensive require trained clinicians to administer and may be limited by available translations and cultural adaptations For countries with limited ASD resources like Bangladesh obtaining a diagnosis which is essential for receiving an intervention and improving outcomes is difficult There is a pressing need to further develop opensource tools that do not require extensive training and professional certification and have high crosscultural validity for autism screening globally Previous work has shown the feasibility and efficacy of assessing developmental delay using rapid assessment tools delivered PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children by professionals with limited clinical expertise in the home There is potential to extend the reach of assessment tools and decrease health care disparity especially in developing and rural countries by using machine learning and mobile technologies In our previous works we have developed tools for rapid mobile detection of ASD in short home videos of US children by using supervised machine learning approaches to identify minimal sets of behaviors that align with clinical diagnoses of ASD Features extracted in our minimally viable classifiers are accurately labeled by nonexpert raters ie noncertified clinical practitioners in a short period of time eg minutes These labeled features can then be fed into our machine learning classifiers to determine the childs autism risk Tariq et al used a dataset consisting of videos ASD neurotypical development TD of US children to validate these classifiers The topperforming classifier exhibited an accuracy of CI Additionally an independent validation set consisting of videos ASD TD was labeled by a separate set of video raters in order to validate the results The topperforming classifier maintained similar results achieving an overall accuracy of CI The current study aimed to show generalizability of videobased machine learning procedures for ASD detection that have established validity among USbased children in Bangladesh Specifically our study aimed to determine the performance and accuracy of this same video machine learning procedures on videos of Bangladeshi children under the age of years This sample was drawn from a population diagnosed with ASD and another population with other speech and language conditions SLCs but not ASD Additionally we compared the features that are most important for accurate classification of children from Bangladesh and created several machine learning models that can be generalized to different cultures Methods Data Collection The study received ethical clearance under Dr Naila Khan from the Bangladesh Institute of Child Health Dhaka Shishu Childrens Hospital DSH and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board We aimed to recruit children for this study with ASD with an SLC and with neurotypical development TD All participants were recruited after they provided consent in Bengali language for participation at the DSH and their children were screened for the presence of ASD or SLC Participants were enrolled if they were parents above years of age had a child between the ages of months and years could attend an appointment at the DSH to complete the study procedures and were willing to submit a brief video of their child to the study team Enrolled families provided demographic information see Table in the Results section Brief videos minutes were recorded during evaluation of the children who presented to the Child Development Center of the Bangladesh Institute of Child Health with neurodevelopmental concerns We administered the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Bangla version to all children to identify the presence of ASD and all children underwent additional clinical evaluations by a developmental psychologist and a child health physician in order diagnose ASD SLC or TD as described previously We also administered the ADOS for of the children identified with ASD ADOS could not be completed in the remaining children diagnosed with ASD because their families were unable to commit to the time required to complete the assessment a common problem for families in low resource areas Acquired videos and supporting demographic measures were securely sent from DSH to Stanford University Videos were assessed for quality by trained clinical researchers at Stanford University Criteria included video sound and image quality in addition to video length and content ie ensuring that the video was long enough to answer necessary questions that the child was present in the video etc Furthermore videos were assessed to meet the following criteria it captured the childs face and hands it involved social interaction or attempts of social interaction and it involved an interaction between the child and a toyobject Video Raters PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children Nine nonBengali speaking USbased raters with no clinical training used a secure HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actcompliant online website to watch the videos and answer a set of multiplechoice questions corresponding to the behavioral features of autism Each rater completed a hour training session with a senior analyst before scoring the videos Senior analysts conducted rater quality checks by comparing a subset of video scores to gold standard scores These gold standard scores were agreed upon by two clinical research coordinators who each had several years of experience with children with autism Source Classifiers Trained on Clinical Data for ReducetoPractice Testing We assembled eight published machine learning classifiers to test their viability for use in the rapid mobile detection of autism through the use of short home videos of US children For all eight models the source of training and validation data was itemlevel medical records of US children which contained either the ADOS or ADIR outcome data on all participants The ADOS has several modules containing approximately features that correspond to the developmental level of the individual under assessment These features are assessed based on how a child interacts with a clinical practitioner administering the exam The ADIR is a parentdirected interview that includes elements asked of the parent with multiple choices for answers Each model was trained on itemlevel outcomes from the administration of either the ADOS or ADIR and optimized for accuracy sparsity of features and interpretability in previous publications All these classifiers have been validated with US home videos total n ASD n nonASD n The top three performing classifiers in this dataset were chosen for validation of the videos collected from DSH in Bangladesh to test the accuracies of these models across cultures Stacked Classifiers With RaterAdaptive Weighting In an effort to improve the results on the Bangladeshi dataset after attempting to validate previously built classifiers on these data we constructed new classifiers while controlling for potential noise resulting from inaccurate ratings and constructed separate layers for each step of the classification for a streamlined approach Our dataset contained three classesTD ASD and SLCassigned by screening via clinical evaluation at the DSH By implementing a layered approach to classificationfirst distinguishing general developmental delays including ASD and SLC from TD and then distinguishing ASD from SLCs we were able to broaden the detection capabilities to more generally classify the presence of other developmental delays in addition to ASD specifically Rater Weighting Given the raters lack of formal clinical training we hypothesized that some raters might be more adept at identifying certain risk factors in some videos than others Regardless of whether these interrater differences in identification accuracy for certain subsets of behaviors arise naturally or by chance we hypothesized that this heterogeneous rater performance could be leveraged to yield increased model performance For example if one rater is especially capable of labeling a childs level of eye contact and another rater does a poor job of rating eye contact but excels at rating language ability then a model trained on each individual raters labels alone might perform poorly however an ensemble that considers the outputs of both raters models could perform substantially better Achieving this improved performance is the focus of our proposed novel rateradaptive weighting scheme For each of the three raters in the dataset we trained a Random Forest classifier to predict a childs class label TD SLC or ASD based on the raters annotations of that childs behavior in a given video The Random Forest classifier adapts to each raters expertise and labeling patterns a basic analysis revealed that each rater had a different feature set that they rated well In addition to and in part because of interrater differences in the labeling ability each raters model had varying levels of accuracy We wanted the ensemble to weigh the predictions from the most accurate rater models more heavily Therefore we first trained and calculated the accuracy of each raters model relative to a majority vote baseline and then used that difference to up or downweigh that raters vote relative to the other raters votes Specifically we let z represent the difference in accuracy of rater j s model relative to the majority vote baseline Then after calculating z for each rater j K we pass these values into the softmax function to generate raterspecific weights PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children This ensures that all the raters weights collectively sum up to so that the ensemble prediction will be a linear combination of each raters predictions Using these weights the final ensemble prediction for child iis calculated by multiplying each rater models predicted probability for the target class eg atypical development or ASD by the corresponding raterspecific weight and adding the weighted raters predicted probabilities together More specific details can be found in Multimedia Appendix Stacking Classifiers to Distinguish Between TypicalAtypical Development and Autism Spectrum DisorderSpeech and Language Conditions In order to reflect the differences in both the conceptualization and use cases of predicting TD vs atypical development and ASD from other developmental delays we decided to create a stacked approach to classification In the first layer we built classifiers to distinguish between TD and atypical development ASDother SLCs The cases classified as atypical from the first layer were then used as input for the second layer to distinguish between ASD and other SLCs We wanted to optimize the model for sensitivity in the first layer to ensure no atypical case was misclassified In the second layer we wanted to optimize for both sensitivity and specificity so that children with ASD would be effectively distinguished from children with other development delays After training these classifiers for each rater we tested them on the heldout test set and aggregated rater scores using the rater weights calculated in the previous step For each of these layers we used a threefold cross validation approach to select the training and test sets randomly in order to ensure that the accuracy reported is stable across different splits Feature Importance To determine the impact of each videos annotations on the classifiers predicted label for that video we used a recently developed method for efficiently calculating approximate Shapley values Shapley values are traditionally used in coalitional game theory to determine how to optimally distribute gains earned from cooperative effort The same idea can be extended to machine learning in order to rank features for nonlinear models such as Random Forests In the machine learning adaptation of Shapley values feature values cooperate to impact a machine learning models output which in this case is the predicted probability of a childs video being classified as TD ASD or SLC For each video Shapley values capture both the magnitude of importance for each feature value as well as the direction in which the feature value pushes the final predicted class probability More precisely if we let F x be the impact Shapley value of the k th feature for video i with feature vector x on the output of model F then the Shapley value formulation guarantees that In other words any videos final predicted class probability is the average predicted class probability of the dataset plus all the Shapley values associated with each element of that videos input vector This property called local accuracy indicates that the feature importance can be easily measured and compared Additionally because each video feature and model triple is associated with a single scalarvalued feature importance we can understand how each annotation for each childs video affected hisher predicted probability of TDASDSLC at an individual level and estimate a features overall importance to the model by summing up the absolute values of that features Shapley values over all videos The features with the highest sum of absolute Shapley values are considered the most important to the model Finally given the way in which we ensembled individual raters models we can extract Shapley values for the multirater ensemble by employing the same weights Specifically we can employ the following equation To test whether our classifiers decisions align with clinical intuition we calculated Shapley values for the videos for the second layer of the classifier when distinguishing ASD from nonASD PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children Comparing Bangladeshi and US Results In order to determine the generalizability of one datascts characteristics to the other we trained logistic regression classifiers with elastic net regularization for the Bangladeshi data and US data to predict ASD from the nonautism class We trained the model on the Bangladeshi data and tested the model on the US data and vice versa For both classifiers we randomly split the dataset into training and testing reserving for the latter while using crossvalidation on the training set to tune hyperparameters associated with elastic net regularization Note that while traditional logistic regression seeks to find a set of model coefficients B that minimizes the logarithmic loss we will denote this loss as where represents the models predictions when the model is parameterized by B logistic regression with elastic net regularization seeks to minimize the logarithmic loss plus a regularization term Here the first sum corresponds to an Lloss the second sum corresponds to an Lloss p is a hyperparameter governing the balance between the two losses and a is the second hyperparameter determining the overall strength of regularization Incorporating this regularization into the logistic regression loss yields several benefits including more parsimonious and interpretable models and better predictive performance especially when two or more of the predictor variables are correlated We used crossvalidation for model hyperparameter tuning by performing a grid search with different values of a varying penalty weights and p the mixing parameter determining how much weight to apply to L versus L penalties Based on the resulting area under the curve AUC and accuracy from each combination we selected the topperforming pair of hyperparameters Using this pair we trained the model using logistic regression and balanced class weights to adjust weights that were inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data which helps account for class imbalance After determining the topranked features based on the trained model and the resulting coefficients we validated the model on the reserved test set The behavioral features that were selected most often during the hyperparameter tuning phase across different crossfolds were compared between US and Bangladeshi models to determine which features have a greater significance and whether they align between the two models Software Analyses were performed in Python we used pandas to prepare the data for analysis The classification models described were trained and evaluated using the scikitlearn package Hyperparameters for each rater model were tuned using the hyperopt package Shapley value estimates were calculated using the shap package Plots were generated using matplotlib Results Data Collection We collected videos in total videos were of children with ASD were of children with SLC and were of children with TD The parentsubmitted home videos were an average of minutes seconds long SD minute seconds Of the videos submitted all were manually inspected and found to be of good scorable quality in terms of length resolution and content Demographic data were missing for subjects who were excluded from analysis all other data were complete Video rating staff were able to rate all videos Table outlines the diagnosis and demographic breakdown for of the videos included in the dataset Results of Source Classifiers Trained on Clinical Data for ReducetoPractice Testing We first sought to distinguish AD from nonASD cases Our top performing classifiers from our previous analysis of the videos from US children were validated on the Bangladeshi dataset We tested across different traintest splits and achieved a maximum AUC of SD Figure In order to improve classifier performance we next shifted to the development of stacked classifiers PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children Results From Stacked Classifiers With RaterAdaptive Weightings Since we used a threefold crossvalidation approach we trained and tested the models for each of the raters across three different splits The training set consisted of randomly selected videos and the average demographic information for the three splits for the training set was as follows average age years months SD months proportion of males proportion of children with TD proportion of children with SLC and proportion of children with ASD The demographic information for the test set for layer distinguishing TD from ASDSLC and layer distinguishing ASD from SLC can be found in Table Layer of the stacked classifier which sought to distinguish between children with TD from children with atypical development achieved SD sensitivity and SD specificity with an AUC of SD and an accuracy of SD Figure A For layer which distinguished ASD from other SLCs the classifier performed with SD sensitivity SD specificity with an AUC of SD and accuracy of SD Figure B Table Feature Importance The most important features in our rateradaptive ensemble for predicting ASD as measured by the Shapley value align with clinical intuition Figure shows the distribution of Shapley values across all participants for two of the features that were among the most important as measured by mean absolute Shapley value to our ensemble models predictions For example for the feature corresponding to the childs level of eye contact the value rarely or never does this contributes strongly to a classification of ASD and exhibits clear flexible gaze that is meshed with other communication contributes the most to a nonASD classification Another feature that aligns with clinical intuition measures the childs repetitive interests and stereotyped behaviorsthe feature value behaviors observed the entire time contributes strongly to the positive class ASD whereas not observed contributes strongly to the negative class nonASD Figure Comparison of Bangladeshi and US Results For the classifier trained on the Bangladeshi data the performance on the heldout test set of Bangladeshi data was and its performance when validated on US data was Figure We trained a similar classifier on our dataset of US videos and validated it on the Bangladeshi data Figure The classifier performed with a accuracy when tested on the heldout test set from US videos The classifiers accuracy dropped significantly when validated on the Bangladeshi data reaching around While performing hyperparameter tuning on these classifiers we conducted further analysis to determine which of the behavioral features were selected most often for each crossfold of US videos and Bangladeshi videos in order to draw a comparison It is apparent from Figure A and B that the features being selected are quite similar between the two datasets with some minor differences The features understands language sensory seeking calls attention to objects and stereotyped interests and actions are highly ranked by models trained on either of the datasets Responsiveness developmental delay social participation and stereotyped speech are selected more often for US data and less so for Bangladeshi data The opposite is true for eye contact Discussion Principal Results We were able to demonstrate the potential to use videobased machine learning methods to detect developmental delay and autism in a collection of videos of Bangladeshi children at risk for autism Despite language cultural and geographic barriers this outcome shows promise for remote autism detection in a developing country More testing and refinement will be needed but in general there is potential for the method to be made virtual to run entirely on mobile devices and therefore potential to increase the capacity to detect and provide more immediate diagnostics to children in need of therapeutic interventions PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children An important result of our work is that we were able to gather videos from Bangladeshi parents collected via mobile phone through our collaboration with DSH This suggests feasibility of expanding this study to a larger sample size across Bangladesh and other lowresource settings and the ability to rely on the use of mobile phones in developing countries like Bangladesh where of the population are mobile phone subscribers Additionally we found that clinically untrained USbased nonBengali speaking raters were able to score videos of Bangladeshi children with limited training suggesting that speaking the native language may not be necessary for scoring videos This finding also demonstrates the validity and potential of this mobile tool to be deployed across cultures and languages A useful and novel contribution of our work was our method for ensembling predictions from models trained on and adapted to each individual rater This method demonstrates several advantageous properties First because each classification model was trained to map an individual raters annotation patterns to a predicted class label these rateradaptive models can capitalize on features reflecting a raters strengths while ignoring features on which the rater shows weaker performance Furthermore the fact that raters models are trained independently from one another means that in a distributed setting where there is a large corpora of videos such that each rater annotates only a small subset of them our method can make predictions on each video by applying and ensembling the models from each rater without any need for additional imputation By weighting each raters model according to its accuracy on a raterspecific held out validation set the overall ensemble can lean more heavily on those raters whose models consistently demonstrate the best classification performance Finally because the final ensembles prediction is a linear combination of all of the raters models and we are able to calculate Shapley values for every feature in each of these models it follows that we can use the same weights from the ensemble of raterspecific predictions to generate ensemblelevel Shapley values as well Thus if a childs video is distributed to several different raters and those raters annotations are fed into the ensemble model one can interpret how each of the childs behavioral annotations contributed to both the final ensemble classification label and each raters predicted label individually We found that while models trained on videos of US children and models trained on Bangladeshi children both relied on many of the same clinically relevant features eg sensory seeking stereotyped interests and actions some features were more prominent in one model compared to the other For example models trained on US data tended to rely more heavily on social participation and stereotyped speech while models trained on Bangladeshi data relied more on eye contact These patterns make sense as raters could rely on a mutual understanding of the language English to evaluate behaviors like stereotyped speech and social interaction in US videos and may not have needed to rely as heavily on physical cues like eye contact whereas when US raters viewed Bangladeshi videos nonlanguagebased cues became more important Even without the ability to confidently evaluate all aspects of the childs behavior the rater ensemble demonstrated that the set of behavioral features needed to make an accurate diagnosis of developmental delays including ASD may be narrower than previously thought Nevertheless the difficulty in assessing certain sociolinguistic patterns in the crosscultural context may have been the cause of comparatively lower performance in the Bangladeshi dataset We hypothesize that when trained on annotations provided by raters who share a common linguistic and sociocultural background with the Bangladeshi children our ensembles performance will improve and become comparable to the models trained and evaluated on the US dataset Limitations Although accuracy achieved using our source classifiers originally trained on US datasets was lower when applied to Bangladeshi videos it still indicated a signal in the Bangladeshi dataset The relatively low accuracy is most likely a result of three factors First these original classifiers were trained on clinical scoresheets not on features obtained from live video data Second these scoresheets were obtained from formal clinical assessments of US children and therefore they do not capture a culturally diverse set of behavioral nuances Third these classifiers were trained to distinguish between typically developing children and children with autism However this dataset consists of delays other than autism eg SLCs which may be why these classifiers were unable to classify these cases with higher accuracy Conclusions PM Detecting Developmental Delay and Autism Through Machine Learning Models Using Home Videos of Bangladeshi Children Although the potential uses for a method of crowdsourced annotation and classification of developmental disorders like the one we established in this work are myriad we wish to highlight a few uses First in areas where resources are scarce and with a disorder like ASD where early intervention is the key to successful treatment our framework could be essential in performing costeffective and reliable triage Parents could send short home videos of their children to the cloud at which point the video would be routed to several raters who perform feature tagging of the childs behavior Based on the raters previous annotation patterns and their associated models the child would receive a predicted risk probability of developmental delay or ASD and a clinical team nearby could then be alerted as appropriate Since Dr Khan and her team have assisted the government to establish multidisciplinary Child Development Centers in tertiary hospitals across Bangladesh Fifteen such Child Development Centers are currently operational whose chief mandate is to diagnose and provide appropriate management for a range of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism However in a country with population of million of whom an estimated are within the pediatric age groups access to reliable services can be limited Formalization of the approaches documented here could enable broader reach and coverage through remote care while allowing resourcestrapped clinical teams to deploy their efforts where they are needed the most An exciting second consequence of a deployment like this would be the steady development of a large corpus of annotated videos No such dataset exists to date however the potential impact of such a dataset could be substantial Modern algorithms from machine vision and speech recognition like convolutional and recurrent neural networks could use these annotations to earn features from the raw video and audio that are important for detecting developmental disorders including ASD Once trained these models would dramatically accelerate the speed for detection of disorders and ability to accelerate the delivery of useful interventions Another important effect of such a pipeline would be that with locationtagged videos we could develop more accurate epidemiological statistics on the prevalence and onset of developmental disorders like ASD worldwide Better information like this may increase awareness positively impact policy change and advance progress for addressing unmet needs of the children with developmental delays This can have important applications in the developing world by helping countries identify the proportion of the population affected by such delays or impairments and therefore inform policy and gather actionable insights
