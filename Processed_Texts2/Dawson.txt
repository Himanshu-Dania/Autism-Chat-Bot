SCiENtifiC REPORtS DOIs postural control can be detected via computer vision analysis in toddlers with autism spectrum disorder Geraldine Dawson Kathleen Campbell Jordan Hashemi Steven J Lippman n Valerie Smith Kimberly Carpente r Helen Egger Steven Espinosa Saritha Vermeer Jeffrey Baker Guillermo Sapiro Evidence suggests that differences in motor function are an early feature of autism spectrum disorder ASD One aspect of motor ability that develops during childhood is postural control reflected in the ability to maintain a steady head and body position without excessive sway Observational studies have documented differences in postural control in older children with ASD The present study used computer vision analysis to assess midline head postural control as reflected in the rate of spontaneous head movements during states of active attention in toddlers between months of age Mean months of whom were diagnosed with ASD Timeseries data revealed robust group differences in the rate of head movements while the toddlers watched movies depicting social and nonsocial stimuli Toddlers with ASD exhibited a significantly higher rate of head movement as compared to nonASD toddlers suggesting difficulties in maintaining midline position of the head while engaging attentional systems The use of digital phenotyping approaches such as computer vision analysis to quantify variation in early motor behaviors will allow for more precise objective and quantitative characterization of early motor signatures and potentially provide new automated methods for early autism risk identification Although the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder ASD are defined by atypical patterns of social inter action and the presence of stereotyped and repetitive behaviors and interests evidence suggests that differences in motor function are also an important early feature of autism Motor delays could contribute to early hallmark autism symptoms including difficulties in orienting to name involving the eyes and head turns coordinating head and limb movements involved in gaze following and other joint attention behavior such as pointing Teitelbaum et al found that atypical movements eg shape of mouth patterns of lying righting sitting were present by months of age in infants later diagnosed with ASD Another study of videotapes taken of infants weeks of age detected lower levels of positional symmetry among infants later diagnosed with ASD sug gesting atypical development of cerebellar pathways that control balance and symmetry Sixmonthold infants who later were diagnosed with ASD tend to exhibit head lag when pulled to sit reflecting early differences in motor development A study of home videos taken between birth and six months of age found that some infants who were later diagnosed with ASD showed postural stiffness slumped posture andor head lag Other motor symptoms observed in infants later diagnosed with ASD include fluctuating muscle tone and oralmotor abnor malities such as insufficient opening of the mouth in anticipation of the approaching spoon during feeding Longitudinal research with very low birth weight infants revealed that infants who are later diagnosed with ASD had poorer ability in maintaining midline position of the head at weeks of age The authors used visual Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development Department

midline head position and number of changes in position The development of postural control is an index of neuromuscular reactions to the motion of body mass in order to retain stability Previous studies have documented the developmental progression of the ability to maintain an upright posture that is accompanied by decreases in postural sway Several studies with older children with ASD have documented deficiencies in postural control reflected in the presence of postural sway which is accentuated when children with ASD are viewing arousing stimuli including complex multisensory and social stimuli Less is known about the presence of postural sway in young children with ASD Studies of motor and other behaviors in young children have typically relied on subjective and laborintensive human coding to rate and measure behavior The recent use of digital phenotyping approaches such as computer vision analysis CV A of videotaped recordings of behavior has allowed for automated precise and quantitative measurement of subtle dynamic differences in motor behavior We reported previously on a result using CV A to more precisely measure toddlers orienting response to a name call noting that compared to toddlers without ASD toddlers with ASD oriented less frequently when they did orient their head turn was a full second slower on average Such differences in motor speed would likely not be detected with the naked eye during a typical clinical evaluation Anzulewicz et al used smart tablet computers with touchsensitive screens and embedded inertial movement sensors to record movement kinematics and gesture forces in yearold children with and without ASD Children with ASD used greater force and faster and larger gesture kinematics Machine learning analysis of the childrens motor patterns classified the children with ASD with a high level of accuracy In another study using automated methods differences in head movement dynamics were found between yearold children with and without ASD while they watched movies of social and nonsocial stimuli Children with ASD showed more frequent head turning especially while watching social stimuli The authors suggested that the children with ASD might be using head movement to modulate their arousal while watching social stimuli Wu et al used electromagnetic sensors to analyze continuous movements at millisecond time scale in older children with ASD versus typical development They applied a triangular smoothing algorithm to the D positional raw movement data that preserved the local speed fluctuations They found that individuals with ASD exhibited significantly more sensorimotor noise when compared to individuals with typical development The present study used CV A to characterize head movements that didnt involve spontaneous or volitional orienting or turning away from the stimuli Rather we were interested in subtler midline head movements that are more likely related to postural stability The study compared the behaviors of toddlers with ASD versus those without ASD while the children watched a series of dynamic movies involving different types of stimuli including stimuli of both a social and nonsocial nature While the children watched the movies their head movements were automatically detected and tracked using landmarks on the participants face The goal of this analysis was to quantify the rate of spontaneous head movements and to determine whether there were differences in this motor feature between young children with and without ASD Methods Participants Participants were children between months of age Mean months Exclusionary criteria included known vision or hearing deficits lack of exposure to English at home andor car egivers who did not speak and read English sufficiently for informed consent Twentytwo of the children had autism spectrum disorder The nonASD comparison group was comprised of typically developing children and children with language delay or developmental delay of clinical significance sufficient to qualify for speech or developmental therapy Participants in the comparison group had a mean age of months SD and those in the ASD group had a mean age of months SD Ethnicracial composition of the ASD and comparison groups respectively was and white and African American and Asian and and multiracialother Percent males was in the ASD group and in the comparison group Participants were recruited from primary care pediatric clinics by a research assistant referral from their phy sician and by community advertisement All caregiverslegal guardians of participants gave written informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board Methods were carried out in accordance with institutional state and federal guidelines and regulation Diagnostic Assessments Diagnostic evaluations to confirm ASD were based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation ScaleToddler ADOST which were conducted by a licensed psychologist or trained researchreliable examiner overseen by a licensed psychologist The mean ADOST score was SD The mean IQ based on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning Composite Score for the ASD group was SD Developmental andor language delay was determined based on the Mullen Scales SD below the mean in overall learning composite or receptiveexpressive language Stimuli A series of stimuli comprised of brief movies were shown on a smart tablet while the child sat on a caregivers lap The tablet was placed on a stand approximately feet away from the child to prevent the child from touching the screen The stimuli consisted of a series of brief developmentallyappropriate movies designed to elicit positive affect and engage the childs attention The movies consisted of cascading bubbles a mechanical bunny animal puppets interacting with each other and a split screen showing on one side a woman singing nursery rhymes and on the other side dynamic noisemaking toys The lengths of the movies were seconds Bubbles seconds Rhyme and seconds Bunny and Puppets Each movie was shown once except for Bubbles which was shown at the beginning and end of the series The entire series of movies lasted minutes Examples of the stimuli and experimental setup are presented in Fig and described in two previous publi cations Examples of clips from the movies are provided in the Supplementary Material During three of the movies the examiner standing behind the child called the childs name A failure to orient to name is an early SCiENtifiC REPORtS DOIssymptom of autism and results of our analysis of the orienting results have previously been published However all segments when children looked away from the movie including to orient to name as well as all second seg ments post the namecall stimulus were automatically removed from the present analyses Specifically in order to remove any influence on head movement due to the child orienting when his or her name was called we removed the time window starting at cue for the name call prompt a subtle icon used to prompt the examiner to call the name through the point where of the audible name calls actually occurred plus frames seconds Since previous studies have shown that orienting tends to occur within a few seconds after a name call this elim inated segments influenced by the name call Parents were asked to attempt to keep the child seated in their lap but to allow the child to get off their lap if the child became too distressed to stay seated Researchers stopped the task for child due to crying Researchers restarted the task for three participants due to noncompliance Computer Vision Analysis The frontal camera in the tablet recorded video of the childs face throughout the experiment at spatial resolution and frames per second The fully automatic CV A algorithm detects and tracks facial landmarks on the childs face see Fig and estimates head pose angles relative to the camera by computing the optimal rotation parameters between the detected landmarks and a D canonical face model For each video frame the algorithm outputted D positional coordinates of the facial landmarks and head pose angles yaw leftright pitch updown and roll tilting leftright The yaw head pose angle was used to determine the frames when the child was engaged with the movie stimuli where frames exhibiting a yaw pose with a magnitude less than were considered as the child being engaged Following the work of to quantify head movement when the child is engaged less than yaw perframe pixelwise displacements of central facial landmarks were computed and normalized with respect to the childs eye width thus head movement was measured as a normalized proportion of the childs eye width per frame The pixelwise displacements of the central facial landmarks are dependent on the childs distance to the camera in the tablet Although the tablet was placed approximately feet away from the child at the start of the experi ment the child is free to move throughout the experiment thus affecting the magnitude of landmark displace ments when the child is near to the camera the pixel displacements are larger than if the child did the same movement but farther away from the camera Normalizing the displacements with respect to the eyewidth diminishes this distance to camera dependency More formally the head movement between frame n and n is defined as the average Euclidean displacements of the central nose left inner eye and right inner eye

between frame n and n and wnn is the average Euclidean distance between the left and right eye landmarks when the child is engaged between a halfsecond frames before and after frame n Results evaluating the validity of the CV A methods which rely on landmark identification and tracking on the face have been previously published One study demonstrated high reliability between the automatic methods and the expert human rater of head movements with agreement between the computer and expert clinical rater occurring of the time with interrater reliability based on Cohens kappa A second study compared the automatic classification based on landmarks to human coders for head movement demonstrated interrater reliability based on intraclass correlation coefficient ICC Other papers report high reliability between CV A and human coding for head turning in response to name ICC and positive affective expression happy ICC and for ASD and nonASD toddlers The original dataset consisted of framebyframe measurements of head movement with observations for each th of a second Groups interested in direct use of the data can do so via collaboration with the authors due to privacy and consent considerations as well as backend designs and the data will be stored in a separate partition at Duke University In order to prepare the data for statistical analysis we first aggregated the movement measurements by calculating the head movement rate defined as the moving sum of the cumulative framebyframe movement measurements for each frame period representing rd of a second If any indi vidual frames within a frame set were set to missing such as when the facial landmarks were not visible or during the namecall period the moving sum was also set to missing Outliers were addressed by Winsorizing to the th percentile prior to aggregation All statistical analyses were performed separately for each of the movie stimuli To visualize the time series we calculated and plotted the median head movement rate as well as the st and rd quartiles at each second time interval for both ASD and nonASD children Unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios for the association between ASD diagnosis and the rate of head move ment in each second time interval were estimated using a generalized linear mixed loggamma regression model Adjusted estimates controlled for ethnicityrace white other age in months and sex male female To account for potential withinsubject correlations due to repeated measurement we included a random intercept for each participant Results The time series data depicting the rate of head movement defined as the distance traveled per second videoframes for the ASD and nonASD groups are shown in Fig Based on a generalized linear mixed regression model with a log link and gamma distribution adjusting for ethnicityrace age and sex significant associations between diagnostic group ASD versus nonASD and rate of head movement were found during all movies except for the Bubbles the last movie For Bubbles the shorter duration might have affected power to detect a result as there was nevertheless a trend toward a group difference in the same direction as all other movies Results of the analysis are shown in Table Robust group differences in the rate of head movement were evident during out of of the movies For example the rate of head movement among participants with ASD was times that of nonASD participants during the Bunny movie after adjusting for age ethnicityrace and sex Confidence Interval The rate ratio was higher for all movies that had animated and more complex stimuli Bunny Puppets Rhymes and Toys as compared to the less complex Bubbles videos Although the LDDD group was too small to conduct independent analyses of that group as a sensitivity anal ysis the patients with LDDD were from the main regression model and reestimated the associations as shown in Table Overall the results are consistent with those reported in the main analysis in fact the associations are slightly stronger when the LDDD group is removed from the nonASD group Discussion The present study adds to a large and growing body of literature indicating that differences in early motor devel opment are an important feature of ASD We found highly significant differences in postural control reflected in differences in the rate of spontaneous movement of the head between toddlers with ASD versus those without ASD Using an automated objective approach we analyzed data comprised of videoframelevel measurements of head movements with observation for each th of a second and created frame moving sums to capture movement Timeseries data revealed group differences in the rate of head movement across all movies representing a wide range of stimuli such as bubbles a hopping bunny and a woman singing a nursery rhyme paired with dynamic toys An increase in the rate of head movement observed in young children with ASD during states of engaged attention might indicate underlying differences in the ability to maintain midline postural con trol andor atypical engagement of attentional systems in young toddlers with ASD These movements were not defined by spontaneous looking away from the stimulus as was reported by Martin et al Rather they were characterized by a failure to keep the head in a still midline position while viewing the movie This is distinct from the feature studied by Martin et al which was characterized by greater yaw angular displacement and greater yaw and roll angular velocity which was primarily present during the presentation of social stimuli and might reflect sensory modulation The movements we describe in this paper may be similar to those described in previous studies of postural sway in older children with ASD as well as school aged children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD by Heiser et al Heiser et al used infrared motion analysis to record head movements during a continuous performance task and found that boys with ADHD moved their head times as far as typicallydeveloping boys performing the same task In a study of siblings of children with ASD Reiersen and colleagues found that siblings who have impaired motor coordination features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD or both are much more likely to have ASD than are other siblings They suggest SCiENtifiC REPORtS DOIsthat identification of nonspecific traits that can amplify risk for ASD such as attention and motor differences could allow for earlier identification and targeted therapy that modify these traits and potentially reduce later risk for ASD Delays and differences in sensorimotor development have been noted across the lifespan in individuals with ASD from early infancy through adulthood For example Lim et al showed that postural sway and attention demands of postural control were larger in adults with ASD than in typically developed adults Morris et al found that adults with ASD did not use visual information to control standing posture in contrast to adults without ASD Brain imaging studies suggest that atypical motor function in autism may be related to increased

Atypical presentation of motor functions of the cerebellum has been noted in children with ASD as young as months of age Esposito et al identified significant differences in gait pattern reflected in postural asymmetry in toddlers with ASD as compared to those without ASD The sample of toddlers with ASD was recruited from primary pediatric care where children suspected of having autism were then evaluated using goldstandard diagnostic methods Although this method of recruitment increases the likelihood of obtaining a more representative populationbased sample it also results in a comparison group of toddlers without ASD that is much larger than the ASD sample Because the sample of ASD toddlers in this study was relatively small it will be important to replicate these findings with a larger group of children A larger sample would also provide the statistical power to examine whether differences in postural control exist based on individual characteristics of children with ASD such as age sex and comorbid intellectual disability andor ADHD Previous analyses of motor differences associated with ASD often have required laborintensive coding of patterns of behavior that are recognizable by the naked eye Moreover such studies typically use a top down approach in which specific behaviors of interest are defined and then rated by more than one person for reliability assessments The use of digital phenotyping offers multiple advantages over previous methods that rely on human coding namely the ability to automatically and objectively measure dynamic features of behavior on a spatiotemporal scale that is not easily perceptible to the naked eye Because digital approaches are scalable they also allow for collection of larger data sets that can be analyzed using machine learning We anticipate that the use of digital phenotyping will reveal a number of objective biomarkers such as the head movements described in this report which can be used as early risk indices and targets for intervention By combining multiple features that reflect different aspects of sensorimotor function including patterns of facial expressiomn orienting midline head movements reaching behavior and others it might be possible to create a reliable objective and automated risk profile for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders References Teitelbaum P Teitelbaum O Nye J
