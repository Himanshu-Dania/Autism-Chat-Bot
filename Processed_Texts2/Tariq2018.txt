each classifier have been provided autismplos The standard approaches to diagnosing autism spectrum disorder ASD evaluate between and behaviors and take several hours to complete This has in part contributed to long wait times for a diagnosis and subsequent delays in access to therapy We hypothesize that the use of machine learning analysis on home video can speed the diagnosis without compromising accuracy We have analyzed itemlevel records from standard diagnostic instruments to construct machine learning classifiers optimized for sparsity interpretability and accuracy In the present study we prospectively test whether the features from these optimized models can be extracted by blinded nonexpert raters from minute home videos of children with and without ASD to arrive at a rapid and accurate machine learning autism classification Methods and findings We created a mobile web portal for video raters to assess behavioral features eg eye contact social smile that are used by independent machine learning models for identify ing ASD each with accuracy in crossvalidation testing and subsequent independent validation from previous work We then collected short home videos of children with autism mean age years months SD years months and videos of typically developing children mean age years months SD year months Three raters blind to the diagnosis independently measured each of the features from the models with a median time to completion of minutes Although several models consisting of alter nating decision trees support vector machine SVM logistic regression LR radial kernel and linear SVM performed well a sparse feature LR classifier LR yielded the highest accuracy area under the curve AUC CI across all ages tested We used a prospectively collected independent validation set of videos ASD and non ASD and independent rater measurements to validate the outcome achieving lower but comparable accuracy AUC CI Finally we applied LR to the

using mobile devices Further work will be needed to confirm that this approach can accelerate autism diagnosis at scale Author summary Why was this study done Autism has risen in incidence by approximately since and now impacts at least in children in the United States The current standard for diagnosis requires a direct cliniciantochild observation and takes hours to administer The sharp rise in incidence of autism coupled with the unscalable nature of the stan dard of care SOC has created strain on the healthcare system and the average age of diagnosis remains around years years past the time when it could be reliably diagnosed Mobile measures that scale could help to alleviate this strain on the healthcare system reduce waiting times for access to therapy and treatment and reach underserved populations What did the researchers do and find We applied machine learning models to twominute home videos of children with and without autism diagnosis to test the ability to reliably detect autism on mobile platforms Three nonexpert raters measured behavioral features needed for machine learning classification by the models in approximately minutes Leveraging video ratings a machine learning model with only features achieved unweighted average recall UAR on videos and UAR on a different and independently evaluated set of videos with UAR on children at or under The above machine learning process of rendering a mobile video diagnosis quickly cre ated a novel collection of labeled video features and a new video featurebased model with accuracy PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection of autism through machine learning on home video What do these findings mean Short home videos can provide sufficient information to run machine learning classifi ers trained to detect children with autism from those with either typical or atypical development Features needed by machine learning models designed to detect autism can be identified and measured in home videos on mobile devices by nonexperts in timeframes close to the total video length and under minutes The machine learning models provide a quantitative indication of autism risk that pro vides more granularity than a binary outcome to flag inconclusive cases potentially add ing value for use in clinical settings eg for triage The process of mobile video analysis for autism detection generates a growing matrix of video features that can be used to construct new machine learning models that may have higher accuracy for autism detection in home video Clinical prospective testing in general pediatric settings on populations not yet diag nosed will be needed However these results support the possibility that mobile video analysis with machine learning may enable rapid autism detection outside of clinics to reduce waiting periods for access to care and reach underserved populations in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure Introduction Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to noncommunicable disease worldwide accounting for of the global burden of disease A significant con tributor to this metric is autism spectrum disorder ASD or autism which has risen in inci dence by approximately since and now impacts in children in the United States ASD is arguably one of the largest pediatric health challenges as supporting an individual with the condition costs up to million during hisher lifespan in the US and over billion annually in US healthcare costs Like most mental health conditions autism has a complex array of symptoms that are diagnosed through behavioral exams The standard of care SOC for an autism diagnosis uses behavioral instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS and the Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised ADIR These standard exams are similar to others in developmental pediatrics in that they require a direct cliniciantochild observa tion and take hours to administer The sharp rise in incidence of autism coupled with the unscalable nature of the SOC has created strain on the healthcare system Wait times for a diagnostic evaluation can reach or exceed months in the US and the average age of diagnosis in the US remains near years of age with underserved populations average age at ASD diagnosis as high as years The high variability in availability of diagnos tic and therapeutic services is common to most psychiatry and mental health conditions across the US with severe shortages of mental health services in of US counties Behavioral interventions for ASD are most impactful when administered by or before years of age however the diagnostic bottleneck that families face severely limits the impact of therapeutic interventions Scalable measures are necessary to alleviate these bottlenecks reduce waiting times for access to therapy and reach underserved populations in need PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection of autism through machine learning on home video As a step toward enabling fast and accurate access to care for ASD we have used supervised machine learning approaches to identify minimal sets of behaviors that align with clinical diag noses of ASD We assembled and analyzed itemlevel outcomes from the administra tion of the ADOS and ADIR to train and test the accuracy of a range of classifiers For the ADOS we focused our analysis on ordinal outcome data from modules and which assess children with limited or no vocabulary with phrased speech and with fluent speech respectively Each of the ADOS modules uses approximately activities for a clinical obser vation of the child at risk and additional behavioral measurements used to score the child following the observation Our machine learning analyses focused on archived records of the categorical and ordinal data generated from the scoring component of these ADOS exami nations Similarly the ADIR involves multiplechoice questions asked by a clinician of the childs primary care provider during an inclinic interview as with the ADOS we focused our classification task on the ordinal outcome data that resulted from the tests administration These preliminary studies focused on building models optimized for accuracy sparsity and interpretability that differentiate autism from nonautism while managing class imbalance We chose models with small numbers of features with performance at or no more than stan dard error away from best test performance and with interpretable outcomesfor example scores generated by a boosted decision tree or logistic regression LR approach In all these studies have used score data from individuals with autism mixed with low medium and highseverity autism and controls including some children for whom autism may have been suspected but was ruled out and have identified the following classifiers a fea ture alternating decision tree ADTree an feature alternating decision tree ADTree a feature support vector machine SVM a feature LR classifier LR a feature support vector machine SVM a feature LR classifier LR a fea ture LR classifier LR and a feature support vector machine SVM Two of these classifiers have been independently tested in separate analyses In a pro spective headtohead comparison between the clinical outcome and ADTree measured prior to the clinical evaluation and official diagnosis on children NASD Ncontrols median age years the performance measured as the unweighted average recall UAR the mean of the sensitivity and specificity was Separately Bone and colleagues tested the ADTree on a Balanced Independent Dataset BID consisting of ADIR outcome data from participants ASD mean age years SD years and nonASD mean age years SD years and found the performance to be similarly high at Duda and colleagues tested the ADTree with individuals with autism mean age years and nonautism control individuals mean age years and found the performance to be Bone and colleagues also tested this ADTree model in participants from the BID autism mean age years SD years autism spectrum mean age years SD years and nonspec trum mean age years SD yearsand found the performance to be slightly higher at These independent validation studies report classifier performance in the range of the published test accuracy and lend additional support to the hypothesis that models using mini mal feature sets are reliable and accurate for autism detection Others have run similar training and testing experiments to identify topranked features from standard instrument data including Bone and Bussu These approaches have arrived at similar conclusions namely that machine learning is an effective way to build objec tive quantitative models with few features to distinguish mild medium and highseverity autism from children outside of the autism spectrum including those with other developmen tal disorders However the translation of such models into clinical practice requires additional steps that have not yet been adequately addressed Although some of our earlier work has PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection of autism through machine learning on home video shown that untrained video annotators can measure autism behaviors on home videos with high interrater reliability and accuracy the question of what steps must be taken to move from minimal behavioral models into clinical practice remains The present study builds on this prior work to address this question and the hypothesis that features represented in our minimal viable classifiers can be labeled quickly accurately and reliably from short home videos by video raters with no official training in autism diagnosis or child development We deployed crowdsourcing and realtime video analysis for feature label ing to run and evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models trained to detect autism in independent home video repositories This procedure enabled us to test the ability to reduce to practice the process of rapid mobile video analysis as a viable method for identifying autism symptoms and screening In addition as the mobile feature tagging of videos automati cally generates a rich feature matrix it presents the opportunity to train a new artificial intelli gence model that has potentially higher generalizability to the task of automatic detection of autism in short video clips We test this related hypothesis by constructing a novel video fea ture classifier and comparing its results to alternative models in a heldout subset of the origi nal video feature matrix and in an independent external validation set The results from this work support the hypothesis that autism detection can be done from mobile devices outside of clinical settings with high efficiency and accuracy Methods Source classifiers for reducetopractice testing We assembled published machine learning classifiers to test viability for use in the rapid mobile detection of autism in short home videos For all of the models the source of training and validation data was medical records generated through the administration of one of two goldstandard instruments in the diagnosis of autism the ADOS or the ADIR The ADOS has several modules containing approximately features that correspond to developmental level of the individual under assessment Module is used on individuals with limited or no vocabu lary Module is used on individuals who use phrase speech but who are not fluent Module is used on individuals who are fluent speakers The ADIR is a parentdirected interview that includes elements each asked of the parent with multiple choices for answers Each model was trained on itemlevel outcomes from the administration of either the ADOS and ADIR and optimized for accuracy sparsity of features and interpretability For the purpose of brevity without omission of detail we opted to create an abbreviation for each model using a basic naming convention This abbreviation took the form of model typenumber of features For example we used ADTree to refer to the use of an alternating decision tree ADTree with features developed from medical data from the administration of the diagnostic instrument ADOS Module and LR to refer to the LR with behavioral features developed from analysis of ADOS Module medical record data and so on ADTree We Wall and colleagues applied machine learning to electronic medical record data recorded through the administration of the ADIR in the diagnostic assessment of children at risk for autism We used an training and testing split and performed fold crossvalidation for a sample of children with autism and nonautism control participants with an ADTree model containing features The ADTree uses boosting to man age class imbalance We also performed upsampling through bootstrap permu tations to manage class imbalance The model was validated in a clinical trial on participants and in a BID consisting of individuals with autism The lowest sensitivity and specificity exhibited were and respectively UAR PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection of autism through machine learning on home video ADTree We used a dataset of score sheets from ADOS Module for children with ASD and nonautism control participants with a training and testing split and fold crossvalidation to train and test an ADTree model with of the Module fea tures The ADTree uses boosting and has inherent robustness to class imbalance We also performed upsampling through bootstrap permutations to test the sensitivity of model performance to class imbalance This feature ADTree model was independently tested on individuals with autism by Wall and colleagues on individuals with autism and without autism by Duda and colleagues and on individuals autism autism spectrum nonspectrum by Bone and colleagues The lowest sensi tivity and specificity reported were and respectively UAR LR We performed training with ADOS Module records on individuals with autism and individuals without autism with backward feature selection and iterative removal of the single lowestranked feature across folds each with a class split Classes were weighted inversely proportional to class size to manage imbalance The model with the highest sensitivity and specificity and lowest number of features LR with L regulari zation and features was selected for testing We tested the model on independent data from individuals with autism and individuals with no autism diagnosis The lowest sensitiv ity and specificity identified were and respectively UAR SVM We used score sheets from ADOS Module generated by the evaluation of children with ASD and nonASD control participants These data were split into a training and testing set Training and parameter tuning were performed with stepwise backward feature selection and iterative removal of the single lowestranked feature across folds Classes were weighted inversely proportional to class size to manage imbalance Several models were fit to each of the feature crossvalidation folds The model with the highest sensi tivity and specificity and lowest number of features a Support Vector Machine SVM with a radial basis function was then applied to the test set to measure generalization error We tested the model on individuals with autism and individuals who did not qualify for an autism diagnosis The lowest sensitivity and specificity identified on the test set were and respectively UAR LR and SVM In this experiment we used medical records generated through the administration of ADOS Module for children with autism and nonautism control participants The dataset was split into train and test sets with the same proportion for participants with and without ASD in each set Class imbalance was managed by setting class weights inversely proportional to the class sizes A fold crossvalidation was used to select features and a separate fold crossvalidation was run for hyperparameter tuning prior to testing the performance An SVM and an LR model with L regularization showed the highest test performance with features The lowest sensitivity and specificity exhibited on the test set for SVM were and respectively UAR and and respec tively UAR for LR LR and SVM In this experiment we used medical records generated through the administration of ADOS Module for children with autism and nonautism

UAR and and respectively UAR for LR PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection of autism through machine learning on home video Fig Featuretoclassifier mapping Video analysts scored each video with features This matrix shows which feature corresponds to which classifier Darker colored features indicate higher overlap and lighter colors indicate lower overlap across the models The features are rank ordered according to their frequency of use across the classifiers Further details about the classifiers are provided in Table The bottom features were not part of the machine learning process

All models contain approximately fewer questions than the ADIR and fewer questions than the total features mea sured within the ADOS An additional features were chosen for their potential diagnostic value and scored by video raters to assess their suitability for scoring home videos creating a total of features for the mobile video rating process described below Fig Recruitment and video collection Under an approved Stanford University IRB protocol we developed a mobile portal to facili tate the collection of videos of children with ASD from which participants electronically con sented to participate and upload their videos Participants were recruited via crowdsourcing methods targeted at social media platforms and listservs for families of children with autism Interested participants were directed to a secure and encrypted video portal website to consent to participate We required participants to be at least years of age and the primary care providers for a child with autism between the ages of months and years Partici pants provided videos either through direct upload to the portal or via reference to a video already uploaded to YouTube together with age diagnosis and other salient characteristics We considered videos eligible if they were between and minutes in length showed the face and hands of the child showed clear opportunities for or direct social engagement and involved opportunities for the use of an object such as a utensil crayon or toy PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection of autism through machine learning on home video We relied on selfreported information provided by the parents concerning the childs offi cial diagnosis of autism or nonautism the age of the child when the video was submitted and additional demographic information for videos that were submitted directly to the web portal For videos that were provided via YouTube URLs we used YouTube metatags to confirm the age and diagnosis of the child in the video If a video did not include a metatag for the age of the child in the video the age was assigned following full agreement among the estimates made by clinical practitioners in pediatrics To evaluate the accuracy of the parents self report and to safeguard against reporting biases we commissioned a practicing pediatric spe cialist certified to administer the ADOS to review a random selection of videos We also commissioned a developmental pediatrician to review a nonoverlapping random selection of additional videos These clinical experts classified each video as ASD or nonASD Feature tagging of videos to run machine learning models We employed a total of video raters who were either students high school undergraduate or graduatelevel or working professionals None had training or certification for detection or diagnosis of autism All were given instructions on how to tag the questions and were asked to score example videos before performing independent feature tagging of new videos Table Eight machine learning classifiers used for video analysis and autism detection The models were constructed from an analysis of archived medical records from the use of standard instruments including the ADOS and the ADIR All models identified a small stable subset of features in crossvalidation experiments The total numbers of affected and unaffected control participants for

with unique usernames and passwords to access the secure online portal to watch videos and answer questions for each video needed by the fea ture vectors to run the machine learning classifiers Table Features were presented to the video raters as multiplechoice questions written at an approximately seventhgrade reading level The raters who remained blind to diagnosis throughout the study were tasked to choose one of the tags for each feature that best described the childs behavior in the video Each response to a feature was then mapped to a score between and with higher scores indicat ing more severe autism features in the measured behavior or to indicate that the feature could not be scored The behavioral features and the overlap across the models are provided in Fig To test the viability of feature tagging videos for rapid machine learning detection and diag nosis of autism we empirically identified a minimum number of video raters needed to score parentprovided home videos We selected a random subset of videos from the full set of vid eos collected through our crowdsourced portal and ran the ADTree model on feature vectors tagged by all raters We chose to run only ADTree for efficiency reasons and because this model has been previously validated in independent studies We used a samplewithreplacement permutation procedure to measure accuracy as a function of major ity rater agreement with the true diagnostic classification We incrementally increased the number of video raters per trial by rater starting with and ending with drawing with replacement times per trial When considering only raters we required perfect class agreement between the raters With an odd number of raters we required a strict majority consensus When an even number of raters disagreed on classification we used an indepen dent and randomly chosen raters score to break the tie After determining the minimally viable number of video raters we used that minimum to generate the full set of feature vectors on all videos Seven of the models were written in Python using the package scikitlearn and one was written in R We ran these models on our feature matrices after feature tagging on videos We measured the model accuracy through comparison of the raters majority classification result with the true diagnosis We evaluated model performance further by age categories years to years years to years and years For each category we calculated accuracy sensitivity and specificity We collected timed data from each rater for each video which began when a video rater pressed play on the video and concluded when a video rater finished scoring by clicking submit on the video portal We used these time stamps to calculate the time spent annotating each video We approximated the time taken to answer the questions by excluding the length of the video from the total time spent to score a video Building a video feature classifier The process of video feature tagging provides an opportunity to generate a crowdsourced col lection of independent feature measurements that are specific to the video of the child as well as independent rater impressions of that childs behaviors This in turn has the ability to gener ate a valuable feature matrix to develop models that include videospecific features rather than features identified through analysis on archived data generated through administration of the SOC as is the case for all classifiers contained in Table To this end and following the com pletion of the annotation on all videos by the minimum number of raters we performed machine learning on our video feature set We used LR with an elastic net penalty LR ENVF to predict the autism class from the nonautism class We randomly split the dataset into training and testing reserving for the latter while using crossvalidation on the train ing set to tune for hyperparameters We used crossvalidation for model hyperparameter PLOS Medicine November Mobile detection

to apply to L versus L penalties Based on the resulting area under the curve AUC and accuracy from each combi nation we selected the topperforming pair of hyperparameters Using this pair we trained the model using LR and balanced class weights to adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data After determining the topranked features based on the trained model and the resulting coefficients we validated the model on the reserved test set Independent test set for validation of video phenotyping processes We used our video portal and crowdsourcing approaches to generate an independent collec tion of videos for evaluation and feature tagging by different raters than those used in the pri mary analysis These raters had similar characteristics to the original group age education no clinical certifications in developmental pediatrics and were trained for video tagging through the same procedures Ethics statement This study was conducted under approval by

LRENVF with LR L penalty no feature reduction revealed similar results AUCROC test accuracy Fig The top features selected by the model consisted of the following in order of highest to lowest rank speech patterns commu nicative engagement understands language emotion expression sensory seeking responsive social smile stereotyped speech One of these featuressensory seekingwas not part of the full sets of items on the standard instrument data used in the development and testing of the models depicted in Table We then validated this classifier on the remaining videos ASD nonASD from the validation set and the results showed an accuracy of and an AUCROC of Discussion Previous work has shown that machine learning models built on records from stan dard autism diagnoses can achieve high classification accuracy with a small number of fea tures Although promising in terms of their minimal feature requirements and ability to generate an accurate risk score their potential for improving

for L loss with no feature reduction The former chose out of video features AUC area under the curve LRENVF logistic regression with an elastic net penalty ROC receiver operating characteristic remained an open question The present study tested the ability to reduce these models to the practice of home video evaluation by nonexperts using mobile platforms eg tablets smart phones Independent tagging of features by raters blind to diagnosis enabled majority rules machine learning classification of twominute average home videos in a median of minutes at AUC on children ages months to years This performance was main tained at AUC CI in a prospectively collected and independent external set of videos each with independent rater measurement vectors Taking advantage of the probability scores generated by the bestperforming model Lregularized LR model with features to flag lowconfidence cases we were able to achieve a AUC suggesting that the approach could benefit from the use of the scores on a more quantitative scale rather than just as a binary classification outcome By using a mobile format that can be accessed online we showed that it is possible to get multiple independent feature vectors for classification This has the potential to elevate confi dence in classification outcome at the time of diagnosis ie when or more agree on class while fostering the growth of a novel matrix of features from short home videos In the second part of our study we tested the ability for this video feature matrix to enable development of a new model that can generalize to the task of videobased classification of autism We found that an feature LR model could achieve an AUC of on the heldout subset and on the prospective independent validation set One of the features used by this model sensory seeking was not used by the instruments on which the original models were trained suggest ing the possibility that alternative features may provide added power for video classification These results support the hypothesis that the detection of autism can be done effectively at scale through mobile video analysis and machine learning classification to produce a quanti fied indicator of autism risk quickly Such a process could streamline autism diagnosis to enable earlier detection and earlier access to therapy that has the highest impact during earlier windows of social development Further this approach could help to reduce the geographic and financial burdens associated with access to diagnostic resources and provide more equal PLOS Medicine November Mobile

identify the most viable methods of crowdsourc ing video acquisition and feature tagging In addition prospective trials in undiagnosed and in larger morebalanced cohorts including examples of children with nonautism developmental delays will be needed to better understand the approachs potential for use in autism diagnosis Supporting information S Table Results of classifiers on independent
